React is declarative.

An advantage [vue.js][8] has over react is that react requires JSX and JSX 
mangles up the data and operations.

<!-- more -->

## React Component class or react component type
A component takes parameters called `props`, short for *properties*, and returns
a hierarchy of views to display via the `render` method.

In Haskell speak it's as if a render is a functor and component is `fmap`.
```js
component :: render -> props ->  hierarchy of views
```

`render` returns a description of what you wish to render
react takes the description and renders it to a screen
`render` returns a react element (a lightweight description of what to render)

Each React element is a real JavaScript object that you can store in a variable 
or pass around your program.

React components can have state by setting `this.state` in the constructor,
which should be considered *private to the component*.

In JavaScript classes, you need to explicitly call `super();` when defining the 
constructor of a subclass.

We even have a topic on *lifting* state 

When you want to aggregate data from multiple children or to have two child
components communicate with each other, move the state upwards so that it lives
in the parent component.

The parent can then pass the state back down to the children via props, so that
the child components are always in sync with each other and with the parent

It is conventional in React apps to use on* names for the attributes and handle*
for the handler methods.

**Controlled components** child components that receive their state from a
parent component.

React components are made up of react elements which so far look just like HTML
elements to me.


## rendering
Imperative rendering

React comes in here:
 re renders diffs

From: [A Case against the GO TO Statement by Edward Dijkstra][9]

> we should do (as wise programmers aware of our limitations) our utmost best 
> to shorten the conceptual gap between the static  program and the dynamic
> process, to make the correspondence between the program (spread out in text 
> space) and the process (spread out in time) as trivial as possible.



Make things snapshottable:
 * one state to next state


When data changes react re renders entire component

referentially transparent functions/endpoints
 - trivial to predict for given input
 - easy to test

Stateful DOM or any stateful UI toolkit

Solution is a virtual DOM which is implemented in a lib called react

immutability plays well with diffing two states


## Functional components

Rather than return a class extending React.Component, write a fn that takes 
props and returns what should be rendered.


## state
State is similar to props, but it is private and fully controlled by the component.
Local state is exactly that: a feature available only to classes.


### State updates may be asynchronous
**React** may batch multiple `setState()` calls into a single update for
performance.
Because `this.props` and `this.state` may be updated asynchronously, you should 
not rely on their values for calculating the next state.

to fix this use a version of  `setState` that accepts a function e.g

```js
this.setState((prevState, props) => {
  counter: prevState.counter + props.increment
});
```

### State updates are merged
merges the object you provide into the current state.
merging is shallow i.e. leaves other key value pairs untouched

## Handling events
When using React you should generally not need to call addEventListener to add 
listeners to a DOM element after it is created. Instead, just provide a listener
when the element is initially rendered.

You have to be careful about the meaning of this in JSX callbacks. In JavaScript,
class methods are not bound by default. If you forget to bind this.handleClick 
and pass it to onClick, this will be undefined when the function is actually 
called.

[Understanding JavaScript Bind ()][1]


You can use an arrow fn in the callback e.g `onClick={(e) => this.handleClick(e)}`

The problem with this syntax is that a different callback is created each time 
the LoggingButton renders.
In most cases, this is fine. However, if this callback is passed as a prop to 
lower components, those components might do an extra re-rendering.
We generally recommend binding in the constructor or using the class fields 
syntax, to avoid this sort of performance problem.

## Lifecycle hooks

Methods run during the life cycle events
such as mounting and umounting

 - `componentDidMount`: runs after the component output has been 
                        rendered to the DOM.
 - `componentWillUnmount`: 
 
 `this.setState({})` takes an object of new state
 `constructor` runs before the object is created
 
modifying state directly e.g this.state.comment = "I'm new..." 
doesn't lead to a rerender. use set state
 
The only place where you can assign `this.state` is the 
`constructor`.

 - React.Component https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html

### kaznet
App.js has all the paths
triggers container for that component

## Hooks
From Kent C. Dotts videos 13-19
Used to maintain component state

### React.useState
Takes the initial value. Returns an array containing the name and a 
setter for the name.

```js
function MyComponent() {
  const [name, setName] = React.useState('');
  const handleChange = event => setName(event.target.value);

  const [name2, setName2] = React.useState('');
  const handleChange2 = event => setName(event.target.value);
  

  return (
    <div>

      <form>
        <!-- htmlFor is like for in html for but JSX-->
        <label htmlFor="name""></label>
        <input id="name" onChange={handleChange}></input>
      </form>
      {name ? <strong>Helllo {name}</strong> : <span>Please type in name</span>}
      
      <form>
        <!-- htmlFor is like for in html for but JSX-->
        <label htmlFor="name2""></label>
        <input id="name2" onChange={handleChange2}></input>
      </form>
      {name2 ? <strong>Yes? {name}</strong> : <span>Please type in name</span>}

    </div>
  )
}
```

### React.useEffect
A react hook that lets us do things that have side effects e.g save
value to `localStorage`.

useEffect takes a lambda and an array of dependencies where we pass
what we want to sync the state of the world with the state of our 
app.

Check the dependency array with [eslint-plugin-react-hooks][17]
to keep the array up to date.

```js
function MyComponent() {
  // First get what's in localStorage
  const [name, setName] = React.useState(
    /* pass a lambda here to make this initialization lazy
       it will only be called to fetch the intiial value and not in 
       re-renders
     */
    () => window.localStorage.getItem('name') || ''
  );
  
  const handleChange = event => setName(event.target.value);

  // in this case we want to store only name
  React.useEffect(() => {
    window.localStorage.setItem('name', name);
  }, [name]);

  const [name2, setName2] = React.useState('');
  const handleChange2 = event => setName(event.target.value);
  

  return (
    <div>
      <form>
        <!-- htmlFor is like for in html for but JSX-->
        <label htmlFor="name""></label>
        <input id="name" onChange={handleChange}></input>
      </form>
      {name ? <strong>Helllo {name}</strong> : <span>Please type in name</span>}
      
      <form>
        <!-- htmlFor is like for in html for but JSX-->
        <label htmlFor="name2""></label>
        <input id="name2" onChange={handleChange2}></input>
      </form>
      {name2 ? <strong>Yes? {name}</strong> : <span>Please type in name</span>}
    </div>
  )
}
```

The localStorage pattern is common so there's an npm package for it
that has an API like the following:

```js
function useLocalStorage(key, defaultValue='') {
  const [state, setState] = React.useState(
    () => window.localStorage.getItem(key) || defaultValue
  );

  React.useEffect(() => {
    window.localStorage.setItem(key, state);
  }, [state]);

  return [state, setState]
}

function MyComponent() {
  const [name, setName] = useLocalStorage('name', '');
  const handleChange = event => setName(event.target.value);
  
  return (
    <div>
      <form>
        <!-- htmlFor is like for in html for but JSX-->
        <label htmlFor="name""></label>
        <input id="name" onChange={handleChange}></input>
      </form>
      {name ? <strong>Helllo {name}</strong> : <span>Please type in name</span>}
    </div>
  )
}

```

It's convention to have custom hooks begin with `use` that way
[eslint-plugin-react-hooks][17] can check out custom hooks for 
mistakes.


### React.useRef
A ref is a reference to the DOM node created by react.
To get it we use `React.useRef`

A ref is an object with a mutable current property

```ts
function Tild({children}) {
  const tiltRef = React.useRef();
  
  /*
    This code runs after react has updated the DOM
    Interacting with the DOM is impure so we use a useRef hook
   */
  React.useEffect(() => {
   console.log(tiltRef.current)
   // tiltNode is our DOM node with class name my-class
   tiltNode = tiltRef.current
   
   // We may need to clean up our DOM node.
   // Ran when the component is unmounted from the page
   return () => {
     tiltNode.vanillaTilt.destroy()
   }
  }, []); // the empty dependency array makes us not run useEffect between re-renders.
  
  return (
    <div ref={tiltRef} className="my-class">
    ...
    </div>
  )
}
```

# Flux
[Flux][7] architecture for building UIs using react.

Think of flux as new MVC

 - **action**: comes into the system
 - **dispatcher**: traffic controller for the whole thing 
 - **store**: data layer updates whenever we get a new action
 - **view**: re render whenever store says something has changed


Difference from MVC

 - use explicit data instead of derived data
 - separate data from view state
 - avoid cascading effects by preventing nested updates
      - x updates y which updates z
      - let data layer completely finish processing before triggering any 
        additional actions


single direction flow:

flux
![](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1ZqK27JXsy3K5jWjpufpn6h8aEFyNB3gL)
                 
the dispatcher ensures that until store is done
views or anything else can't put an action through the system

advantages:

 - improved data consistency: everything in sync
 - easier to pinpoint root of a bug
 - easier unit tests because modules are pure-ish/atomic/functional



## views
can trigger actions

## dispatcher
enforces no cascading effects once an action goes
into store you can't put another until store is done processing it

# Hackernooon post summary
An implementation of the Flux architecture— a pattern for passing data around in a React app.

*Under classic Flux, app state is held within stores.
Dispatched actions cause this state to change, afterwhich the views that listen to these 
state changes will re-render themselves accordingly*

## Flux
![](https://hackernoon.com/hn-images/1*stmn8kxXJrX9hbk39hHQJA.png)

## Redux
![](https://hackernoon.com/hn-images/1*9kbmrgH8voxp_rx25LPqIw.png)

## Dir structure

 - `/src/component/` *Dumb* React components that have no knowledge of Redux
 - `/src/containers/`  *Smart* React components that are connected to our Redux store
 - `/src/services` Abstraction facades for external API (like backend servers)
 - `/src/store` All Redux-specific code goes here, including all business-logic of our app
    
The store directory is organized by domain, each containing:
    
 - `/src/store/{domain}/reducer.js` Reducer as a default export with all selectors as named exports
 - `/src/store/{domain}/actions.js` All the domain action handlers (thunks and plain object creators)


The *reducer* holds the state and updates it.


Rules:
 - Smart components are not allowed to have any logic except dispatching actions.
 - Services must be completely stateless.
 - Smart components should always access state through selectors.
 - Minimize view logic in smart components by extracting it into dumb components.
 - Place all business logic inside action handlers (thunks), selectors and reducers.
 
### Selectors
A selector is a pure function that takes the global state as argument and returns some transformation over it
Selectors are tightly coupled to reducers and are located inside reducer.js
 
# Redux

Redux has no relation to react but works especially well with it because react 
let's you describe the UI as a function of state.
Redux emits state updates in response to actions.

[Redux docs](https://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started)

## actions
pure functions in redux
only 2 things allowed to interact with the store
one is a reducer it changes the state
others are selectors retrieve data from the state

containers are components aware of global state

all things that fetch lists should be aware of pagination

page numbers

generic for tasks, locations clients

### connect([mapStateToProps], [mapDispatchToProps], [mergeProps], [options])

Connects a React component to a Redux store. 
`connect` is a facade around `connectAdvanced`, providing a convenient API for 
the most common use cases.

It doesn't modify the component class passed to it; instead
it returns a new, connected component class for you to use.

References

 - [React-redux "connect" explained][2]
 - [Usage with React][3]
 - [source code][4]

### mapStateToProps
The result must be a plain object which will be **merged** into the component's 
props.


### mapDispatchToProps


## Provider
To allow all components to access the store use a special react redux 
component <Provider> to make the store available to all container components in
the app without passing it explicitly.

Read more:

 - [provider docs][10]


### Action creator
A function that creates an action.

> action is a payload of information, and an action creator is a factory that 
> creates an action.

Calling an action creator only produces the action but does not dispatch it.
You need to call the store's [dispatch][11] fn to actually cause the mutation

## Reducer
Also called a reducing function function that accepts an accumulation and a 
value and returns a new value

reduce in other langs or fold in haskell.

reduce a collection of values into a single values

most important concept in redux

### [combineReducers](https://redux.js.org/api-reference/combinereducers)
A helper function that turns an object whose values are different reducing 
functions into a single reducing fn you can pass to [`createStore`][13].

the resulting reducer calls every child reducer and gethers the resilt into a
single state object

The state produced by `combineReducers()` namespaces the states of each reducer 
under their keys as passed to `combineReducers()`.

### createStore
creates a single redux store that holds the complete state of your app.

> Your app should have a single store

args: reducer, preloadedState, enhancer

enhancer: **store enhancer** optionally specify it to enhance the store with 
third party capabilities such as middleware, time travel, persistence etc

the only store enhancer that ships with redux is [`applyMiddleware`][14].

### applyMiddleware
Lets you wrap the store's [`dispatch`][11] method
Middleware is composable

Most common use case is to support async actions without much boilerplate code 
or lib dependency.
Does so by letting you dispatch [`async actions`][12] in addition to normal
actions.

https://redux.js.org/api/applymiddleware

#### thunk-redux
lets the action creators invert control by dispatching functions.
They would receive `dispatch` as an arg and may call it async. 
Such functions are called thunks.


#### redux-promise
Lets you dispatch a promise async action and dispatches a normal action when
the promise resolves.

> Middleware is not baked into createStore and is not a fundamental part of the 
> Redux architecture, but we consider it useful enough to be supported right in 
> the core. This way, there is a single standard way to extend dispatch in the 
> ecosystem, and different middleware may compete in expressiveness and utility.

#### Async action
A value that is sent to a dispatching function but not yet ready for 
consumption by the reducer.
It will be transformed by middleware into an action before being sent to the 
base dispatch fn.


### [Store](https://redux.js.org/api-reference/store#dispatch)
Holds the whole state tree of your app.
A store is not a class. It's just an object with a few methods on it.

There's no way to directly modify the store only way is through reducers and 
only way to trigger reducers is to dispatch actions.

to change data dispatch and action
to obtain data we should (need to) go through a selector 

> we get the state of the application at the time we made the select

## Components
Smart components are not allowed to have any logic except dispatching actions.
Smart components should always access state through selectors.

Place all business logic inside action handlers (thunks), selectors and reducers.

### Presentational and container components
reference: [Medium---Presentational and Container Components][6]
aka stateful and pure components among other names

This approach achieves:

 - separation of concerns
 - reusability

## Services
Abstract an external API

> services must be stateless


## State
In Redux, the reducer is the construct that holds state and updates it
