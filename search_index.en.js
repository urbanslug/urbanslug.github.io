This post makes me wish my blog had comments. You could tweet me at @urbanslug if it's not too much work.\n\nSo after many years of not playing chess, at least taking it seriously, I've decided to go back to playing. Why? I thought it would help me with mathematics and logic and programming but it's turned out to be a lot of fun so now I'm doing it because it's fun.\nSo it's like this, I'm getting better at my opening game thanks to mychessblog.com. My middle game and end game will be worked on in that order. I'm not reading any books yet because I have exams to study for but I am reading a lot of online material other than what I've mentioned above and playing a lot more. I will start on a book when I get the time hopefully this December. I will write a review on the book that I will read and how it has impacted my playing.\nAlso I have tried creating a profile on FICS (Free Internet Chess Server) to play online, for some reason they never send me the confirmation email. I guess I'll be playing as guest until I get the time to email an admin and whine. Why I chose FICS? I installed pychess (on my arch) and the online play it has allows for FICS as the default so I went with it.\nI hope this will be as fun as I remember it being back when I was in chess club and there was a coach and not just be a phase. Anyway if mychessblog.com has taught me anything it's that it's not about reading books or memorizing strategies but rather about practice.\n","id":"https://njagi.me/back-to-chess/","title":"Back to Chess"},"https://njagi.me/code-pipeline-overview/":{"body":"Pipeline in this context refers to the collection of steps software goes through\nfrom planning to deployment. Pipeline as code is having this pipeline be stored\nin an executable or/and a version controllable way.\n\nWhy does this matter? A code pipeline that is executable and/or version\ncontrollable:\n\nis easy to keep tracking of as changes occur\nmakes it possible to keep track of the actual and all possible agents of change (people and/or hosts)\nreduces repitition and consequently saves time\nis easy to delegate parts of to tools or completely automate\nhas clear and consistent history\nhas immutable code pipeline history meaning we can revert to previous stable state\nin case of failure, the broken state can be reproduced and post moterms performed\nis much it easier to maintain and keep track of its components in complex architechtures such as microservices\nmakes it much easier to build tools that lower the bar of entry into ops such as running ansible plays and chatops bots\n\nPipeline as code is the next step in planning, provisioning, configuration\nmanagement and application deployment, continuous integration and continuous\ndeployment.\nIt's also a great way to manage growing complexity in terms of both\nthe architechture and teams involved. I just threw a number of buzzwords around\nso let me explain each of them and why they matter.\n\nIt's important to note that the tools used in each step have a lot of overlap between them and a tool is likely to show up in multple sections.\n\nPlanning \n\nSince we can't execute plans as code, yet; we have to settle for version\ncontrolling them.\nSave your execution plans as documentation in a docs/ directory or a git\nsubmodule (or any other format) files and put them in version control.\nYou can also commit .org files you created during meetings, export them into\n.md and add them as docs.\n\nTools: version control systems\n\nProvisioning \n\nProvision is the past participle of provide, in this context it means providing\neverything that your application will need to run.\nIt is an implementation of the infrastructure diagram/plan; it involves the\nto run the software. That is: where to host it, how many servers, OS versions,\nserver requirements, dependencies, file system, directory structure. The answer\nto whether to use a vendor solution like AWS Lamda, or ECS would lie here.\nYou probably need to do this once or at most 3 times ever unless you keep\nchanging core infrastructure. You could put this in an ansible script, ECS task\ndefinitions, docker images, Amazon Machine Images, virtual machine\nimages et cetera.\n\nTools: Packer, Terraform, Ansible, Kubernetes pods, ECS clusters.\n\nConfiguration management \n\n\nApplications today are a collection of tools combined to solve a need.\nIn the example of a simple web application we have a database, an app, an app\nserver and a webserver. Configuration management is basically managing the glue\nthat binds these tools together; which commands to run, which services to start\nand stop and when, arguments, environment variables, order of running them and\nso forth.\n\nTools: ansible vars/vault, ansible plays\n\nApplication deployment \n\nThis is putting all the parts of the application that need to run on their\nrespective servers, starting them and making sure they're all working together\nand correctly.\nIn this case you have vendor tools such as Identity and Access Management from\nAWS which you can build on top of.\nThis will mean having the following in an executable and version controllable\nform: the deploy server, their user, deploy scripts avaible to them,\nactual deploy commands to run and the order in which to run them.\nYou will only need to this during the first deployment or when something goes\nterribly wrong and you have to rollback but even then it's still going to be a\nfew commands or just one. You can also use other tools for deployment such as\nbots.\n\nTools: ansible, puppet, chef\n\nContinuous integration \n\nThis is running tests and building the application to catch errors either in the\ncode or the way parts of it integrate with each other.\nRunning tests, style checks and catching errors in the code.\n\nTools: travis ci, circle ci, gitlab ci\n\nContinuous deployment \n\nOnce the continuous integration tests run and pass, have a tool compile a binary\nor create a commit, push it to a deploy environment and make sure it's running.\nThis is comparable to continuous delivery which accordingo to Wikipedia:\n\"Continuous Delivery means that the team ensures every change can be deployed to production but may choose not to do it, usually due to business reasons\"\n\nTools: travis-ecs-deploy, deploy scripts, terraformy\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nIn this post I've explained how the pipeline can be presented as code but only\nas seperate components not how these components can be combined to work as one.\nIn the next post I'll explain how you can use free tools and some open source\ntools to create a code pipeline that runs from provisioning, configuration\nmanagement, version control, continuous integration and continuous deployment\nrequiring very little input from devops and with as little complexity as\npossible.\n","id":"https://njagi.me/code-pipeline-overview/","title":"Pipeline as Code—Overview"},"https://njagi.me/code-pipeline-putting-everything-together/":{"body":"In this post we shall implement a continuous deployment pipeline using\nansible, travis ci and git.\nDuring implementation we don't have steps such as planning, provisioning,\nconfiguration management etc that we mentioned in the previous post; those are\nconceptual. The flowchart below represents the actual places that our software\nshould live at all times. Think of each component in the flowchart as a service\nthat exposes an API.\n\n\nDeploy server \n\nIn the diagram above we introduce an deploy server.

For example: for this blog, changes that get merged into master go\nstraight into production. This is because the application is really small and\nsimple so before anything goes into master I know it's error free.\nMoreover, even if the blog were to experience downtime I have very little to\nlose compared to a business. This is the same model that github pages uses;\nwhat is in master is pushed into the gh-pages branch which is basically a\ngithub pages blog's production environment.\n\nExposes: git branches and git tags\n\nAnsible (Provisioning and Configuration Management) \n\nAssuming you have a fresh server such as the one Digital Ocean would offer\nor a fresh EC2 instance. We want an ansible play that creates an unprivileged\nuser with SSH authentication.\nSo we have to do the following locally or on our deploy server:\n\ngenerate an SSH key pair without a passphrase\nadd the public key of the generated key to the deploy user's known_hosts file\npush the private key of the generated key to travis ci so that the travis\ncontainer can autheniticate as that user.\n\nGenerate an SSH keypair without a passphrase \n\nUnder Enter file in which to save the key... type in travis-ci.\nUnder Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): just press enter\n$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \"travis@travis-ci.org\"\n\nThis will create two files travis-ci and travis-ci.pub.\nAdd the public key to the deploy user's known_hosts \n\nWrite a play to prepare the deploy environment.\nCopy the contents of travis-ci.pub file to a vars file in your the playbooks\nFor example here's my vars file.\ntravis_ci_pubkey: \"ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAINFzeaPrMXDVS1/+V4hKsgC+Pzoa9tnGGP+VCPT21QXP travis@travis-ci.org\"\n\nAdd a section in a play of your choosing that copies the public key to the\ndeploy user's known_hosts.\n- include_vars: vars.yml\n\n- name: Create deploy user\n  user: name=deploy\n        group=www\n\n- name: copy travis-ci public ssh key to deploy user\n  authorized_key: key=\"{{ travis_ci_pubkey }}\"\n                  path=/home/deploy/.ssh/authorized_keys\n                  user=deploy\n\nThis creates the deploy user and adds the travis-ci.pub\nto the deploy user's ~/.ssh/known_hosts.\nMake your target a git server \n\nFor commands like git push to work from travis-ci to your deploy user\nyou have to have your server be ready to receive git push commands.\nI will explain this later in a different post but for now what you need is a\nplay that:\n\nInstalls git\nCreates a target git repo which we shall push to\nIs able to overwrite the current contents of the repo when a change occurs.\n\n# creates a blog.git dir which is a bare git repo\n- name:    Create a bare blog.git repo\n  command: \"git init --bare blog.git\"\n\n- name: Add a post-receive hook to update blog\n  copy: src=../files/git/hooks/post-receive\n        dest=blog.git/hooks/post-receive\n        owner=deploy\n        group=www\n        mode=0550\n        backup=yes\n#! /bin/bash\n\n# post-recieve hook to handle updates\n# delete the current blog\nrm -rf ~/blog\ncd ~/\n# clone from the blog.git bare repo into a blog dir\ngit clone blog.git blog\n\nIf you take notice this is similar to the bare git repo that github provides.\nFor example: to clone this blog from github via ssh we would run:\n$ git clone git@github.com:urbanslug/blog.git\n\nand if you had ssh access to the server hosting this blog you would run:\n$ git clone deploy@git.urbanslug.com:blog.git\n\nI hope you can draw some interesting parallels there.\nHere's my blog's play for reference.\nIn the case of this blog I run the below command from my deploy server.\n$ ansible-playbook base.yml --ask-sudo-pass --ask-vault-pass\nPush the private key to travis ci \n\nInstall the travis cli tool\n$ gem install travis\n\nEncrypt your private key and add the decryption command to your .travis.yml file\nusing the travis cli tool and also push your public key to travis-ci with:\n$ travis encrypt-file travis-ci --add\n\nThe --add flag  should add a  before_install phase to your .travis.yml file\nthat resembles the following:\nbefore_install:\n - openssl aes-256-cbc -K $encrypted_7f9f7befb56d_key -iv $encrypted_7f9f7befb56d_iv -in travis-ci.enc -out travis-ci -d\n\nThat line decrypts your travis-ci private key in the travis container at runtime\nand creates a ~/travis-ci which is the private key.

Offsets are suited to translating linear reference to graphs because\nit's how variations are viewed within the reference anyway.\nFor example, we could represent a variation \"A\" occuring at position 3 in the \nreference \"ATCGAT\" as:\n\nNotice how we start counting from 0 in the graph? We call that being zero-indexed.\nA ref is a unique identifier which we get from the reference\ndescription line. A graph created from just one reference will have all nodes\ncontain the same value in the ref field.\nAs you may have suspected, some problems arise from this coordinate system.\nThey are a matter of progressive update and read alignment but not a matter\nof initial graph construction and are therefore beyond the scope of this post.\nThey include:\n\nDealing with nodes that are from alignments i.e. not aligned to a linear\nsequence\nChanges in the linear reference which change the coordinate system.\n\nStructure of the Graph \n\nProperties of our graph:\n\nDirected acyclic graph\nOffsets are increasing/ascending natural numbers as we walk through the\ngraph\n\nNode \n\nA node is built out of a racket structure, a struct in many\nlanguages, with the following fields:\nNameDescription\nsegmenta string of alphabet A, T, C, and G\noffsetoffset from zero on the reference\nidsha256 hash of the concatenation of segment, \"+\" and offset\nrefreference from which the segment is derived\nlinksa list of the IDs of the next nodes\n\nThe use of segment and links to mean vertices and edges are inspired by\nA proposal of the Graphical Fragment Assembly format.\nWe generate a sha256 hash out of the segment, a plus symbol and the offset to\ngenerate a value for id.\nFor example, given a segment \"ATCGATG\" at offset 34 we can generate an ID\nlike so:\ngenerate-id(&lt;string&gt; segment, &lt;natural-number&gt; offset)\n  // take note of the + sign in the concatenation\n  string-and-offset  &lt;- concatenate(\"ATCGATG\", \"+\",\"34\")\n  hash-as-bytestring &lt;- sha256hash(string-and-offset)\n  id                 &lt;- bytestring-to-hex-string(hash-as-bytestring)\n  return id\n\nI chose hashes over UUIDs because they are reproducible and will\nhave constant time lookups in the occasion that we want to retrieve a node from\nthe graph given its sequence and offset. This should come in handy in\nvisualization especially on the web.\nI also considered the likelihood of collisions in the hashes. I  expect it to be\nlow when dealing with 15,000 base pair size viruses.\nI shall expound on this in a later post.\nOne thing to note is that vg uses UUIDs and they work for\nhuman genome so I believe graphite, the tool that I'm writing to implement\nthis, can get away with sha256 hashes for more complex genomes.\nVariation \n\nA variation is a structure containing the following fields:\nNameDescription\nsegmenta string of single of alphabet A, T, C, and G\noffsetoffset from zero on the reference\nrefan identifier of the reference it's derived from\n\nIt is extracted from a Variant Call Format file, the main file format for genomic\nvariation data.\nThe Graph \n\nI had to implement a graph in graphite due to the lack of serialization (a\nrequired feature for progressive updates) in the racket graph library;\nI would have preferred to add serialization support to graph but couldn't\ndo that and still stay on track with graphite.\nThe graph is built out of an adjacency map of id, key, to node, value.\nUsing a hash table and not a list has the following pros:\n\nno duplicates\nconstant-time lookups if we have a segment and its offset\n\nand cons:\n\nlacks ordering despite linear offsets which would come in handy for updates\n\nConstruction \n\nThe general idea is:\n\nGiven a list of variation structures sorted by offset and a\nlinear reference (string).\nLoop through each variation and insert an alternative segment into the\nreference at the position specified in the variation.\n\nIn the case of graphite, we recursively split the reference into a list of\npairs that imply directionality.\nFor example, the pair (a b) would translate to an edge from node a to node b.\nWe then have a function gen-directed-graph that takes this list of pairs\nand generates a directed graph from it using foldl. Graphite creates the graph\nin the 3 steps detailed below.\n1. Generate a Node List (of Pairs) \n\nO(n); n being the size of the variation list\ngen-node-list(reference, variations, prev-position = f, prev-nodes = &lt;empty-list&gt;)\n  if empty-list? variations\n    // the base case of gen node list\n    cap(reference, previous-position, previous-nodes)\n  else if (is-number previous-position) and (previous-position = current-offset)\n    // we have more than one variation in this position\n    handle-duplicate(reference, variations, previous-position, previous-nodes)\n  else\n    // we have just one variation in this position\n    handle-unique(reference, variations, previous-position, previous-nodes)\n\n\nreference: the linear reference\nvariations: a list of variations\nprev-position: the offset of the previous variation\n\nthe default value is false. (I wish I used an int here)\n\n\nprev-nodes: the previous node or nodes with relation to the current one\n\nthe default value is an empty list.\n\n\n\nA mutually recursive function takes from the tail of variation list,\nvariations, and returns a list of pair of nodes (a, b) where the direction\nof the nodes is a -&gt; b for example a list like [(a b), (b c), (c d)] should\nlater  translate to a -&gt; b -&gt; c -&gt; d.\n1.1 Cap \n\nCreates the initial variation i.e \"caps\" the directed graph.\nIt creates a first node that points to the first variations.\ncap(reference, previous-position, previous-nodes)\n  map(\n    lambda node: (substring(reference, 0, previous-position), node)\n    previous-nodes\n    )\n1.2 Handle Unique \n\nInserts a variation where there isn't an alternative.\nIn a case where there's only 1 alternative path so we break the current sequence\nand insert our alternative path, for example,  a -&gt; b and a -&gt; c.\nhandle-unique(reference, variations, previous-position, previous-nodes)\n  ...\n1.3 Handle Duplicate \n\nInserts extra alternative variations where they already exist.\nfor example a -&gt; b, a -&gt; c and a -&gt; d.\nhandle-duplicate(reference, variations, previous-position, previous-nodes)\n  ...\n2.

Zurich\n\nWoody Allen \n\nWoody Allen used a typewriter and not a computer\n\nPeter Higgs \n\nTheoretical physicist (Higgs boson). He was so isolated that journalists couldn't find him when he won a Nobel Prize.\n\nJ.K. Rowling \n\nNot on social media written the Harry Potter series amongst other things\n\nBill Gates \n\nConducted think weeks 2 times a year; he would isolate himself and do nothing but read and think deep thoughts.\nThanks to this he wrote his famous \"Internet tidal Wave\" memo.\n\nJason Benn \n\nFinancial analyst and later a computer programmer who learned to work deep on his own.\n\nDeep work hypothesis \n\nThe ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare and at exactly the same time it's becoming increasingly valuable in our economy.\nConsequently, the few who cultivate this skill and make it a core of their working life will thrive.\n\nHow the book is organized \n\n\nPart 1: To prove the hypothesis true\nPart 2: To tech the reader how to perform deep work\n\n\nPart 1 - The Idea \n\n\nChapter 1 - Deep Work is Valuable \n\n\nThere will be 3 types of winners in the information age \n\nThis is an idea raised in Race Against The Machine and its corresponding research brief.\n\n\nHigh skilled workers\nThose who can work well and creatively with intelligent machines\nThey have the ability to work with and tease valuable results out of increasigly complex machines will thrive\nCites; Nate Silver - stats geek turned elections forecaster\n\n\nThe superstars\nThose who are the best at what they do; they stand out of the crowd.\nCites; David Heinemeier Hansson - creator or ruby on rails.\n\n\nThe owners\nThose with access to capital to invest in new tech that's driving the great restructuring\nCites; John Doerr - investor\n\n\n\n2 core abilities for thriving in the new economy \n\nGiven this isn't a book about making tons of money it focuses on the first two.\nTo end up as a super star or a highly skilled worker you need the following two abilities which depend on your ability to perform deep work:\n\nThe ability to quickly master hard things.\nThe ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed.\n\n\nDeep work helps you quickly learn things \n\nTo learn requires intense concentration; cites The Intellectual Life: Its Spirit, Conditions, Methods  - Antonin Sertillanges, written by a monk who had tried to master the fundamentals of intellect. He then goes on to how we end up learning and being good at \"hard things\".\n\n\nDeliberate practice\nMoves on to cite the paper The Role of Deliberate Practice in the Acquisition of Expert Performance - K. Anders Erricsson.\nIn this paper Ericsson coins the word deliberate practice as what distinguishes people who get really good at their filed from everyone else.\nThe differences between expert performers and normal adults is a life long period of deliberate effort to improve performance in a specific domain\nThis paper is what Malcom Gladwell is said to have misread when he wrote Outliers and made the ten thousand hour claim.\n\n\nCore components of deliberate practice\n\nYour attention is focused on the skill you're trying to master.\nYou receive feedback so you can correct your approach.\n\n\n\nNeuroscintific justification\nTo be great at something is to be well mylinated.\nBy focusing on a specific skill you're forcing the specific (relevant to that task) circuit to fire again and again in isolation.\nThe repititive use of a specific circuit causes oligodendrocytes (cells) to begin wrapping layers of myelin around those specific neurons therefore cementing the skill.\nFocus is the only way to isolate the relevant neural circuit enough to trigger useful myelination.\n\n\n\nAdam Grant \n\nYoungest full professor at Wharton and author of Give and Take.\nHe batches hard tasks into long uninterrupted stretches\nDoes this at multiple levels:\n\nwithin the year:\n\nteaching: fall\nresearch: spring and summer\n\n\nwithin the research semester:\n\ndoor is open to colleagues and students\nperiods of isolation\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Adam Grant divides his writing\nInto 3 district tasks:\n\nanalyzing the data\nwriting a full draft\nediting the draft into something publishable\n\n\n\nLaw of productivity\nComes from Cal Newport and he doesn't cite it but it goes:\nhigh quality work = time spent * intensity of focus\n\n\n\nAttention residue \n\nBased on Sophie's research on multi tasking.\nThe effect of attention residue is introduced by Sophie Leroy's in her 2009 paper Why is it so Hard to do My Work? The Challenge of Attention Residue when Switching Between Work Tasks.\nThe gist of this theory is that when you switch from task A to taks B your attention doesn't immediately shift to the new task, a residue of your attention remains on the original task.\nHer conclusion was \"People experiencing attention residue after switching between tasks are likely to demonstrate poor performance on that next task.\"\n\nJack Dorsey \n\nWhen it comes to high performing people who don't work deeply Newport focuses on Jack Dorsey.\nJack Dorsey and Kerry Trainor don't work deeply because they're coordinating large groups of people.\nIt's better to hire subordinates to do the deep work and advise them. However, these kinds of people represent a small percentage of the world.\nExample groups where deep work isn't valued because constant connection is their most valuable resource:\n\nexecs\nsalesmen\nlobbyists\n\n\nChapter 2 -  Deep work is rare \n\nDeep work is paradoxically rare in organization and here's why according to Newport.\n\nTrends in organizations that derail deep work \n\n\n\nOpen offices\n\n\nInstant messaging\n\n\nA push to maintain a social media presence\n\n\nThe metric black hole\nWe have no way to measure the value that such messaging produces and offset it against how much it costs?\n\n\nThe principle of least resistance\nUsing email and instant messaging to avoid planning one's day and time\nWithout clear feedback on the impact of various behaviors to the bottom line, we will tend towards behaviors that are easiest at the moment.\ne.g clearly defining goals and the direction of a project\n\n\nWhy cultures of connectivity persist\n\nIt's easier; you don't have to plan your work\nit makes it acceptable to run your day out of you inbox\n\ntech has come up with stand up meetings to solve this problem of not planning and just talking all day\n\n\n\n\nBusyness as a proxy for productivity\nIn the absence of clear indicators of what it means to be productive and valuable in their\njobs, knowledge workers turn back towards and industrial indicator of productivity;\ndoing lots of work in a visible manner.\nWe could eliminate this commitment to busyness if we could how much it costs.\ncites:\n\nRichard Feynman who claimed to be responsible to avoid admin work and focus on physics.\nMatthew Crawford quit his job as the director of a think tank to repair motorcycles.\nMarrisa Mayer CEO of Yahoo banned employees from working from home when she felt that people weren't being productive because they didn't log into the VPN enough; a task mainly done to check email.\n\n\n\nthe cult of the Internet\nDeep work can't compete because it's old fashioned and requires time to cultivate.\nThis means companies even to their detriment have to embrace social media or become obsolete\n\n\ntechnopoly\nCoined by Neil Postman, a culture since the invention of the PC where we only\nconsider the of metrics tech but not it's detriments.\nTechnopoly eliminates it's alternatives by making them invisible and therefore irrelevant.\n\n\n\n\nBad for business, good for you\nHere Newport claims that it may be bad for business not to value deep work but it's a chance for\nthe reader to foster their ability to do deep work so that they can stand out.\nGiven deep work is becoming increasingly rare and valuable;\nthe reader should take this as an opportunity to  practice it.\n\n\n\nChapter 3 - Deep work is meaningful \n\nTalks about  Ric Furrer a craftsman who finds meaning in a craft.\nThen goes on to show that just as much meaning can be got\nfrom intellectual work as from a craft.\n\nNeurological argument for depth \n\nTalks about Winifred Gallagher who after a cancer diagnosis chose to focus on her life and not on the disease.\nHer life during this period was quite pleasant while one would have expected it to have been mired by grief.\nOur brains construct our world-view based on what we pay attention to.\nWho you are, what you feel, what you are is the sum of what you focus on.\nIf you spend enough time in the state of deep work your mind will interpret your world as rich in meaning and importance.\nDoing knowledge work in a shallow way leeches meaning from the person's life.\nLaura Carstensen, used an fMRI scanner to study brain behaviour of subjects presented with negative and positive imagery.\nFor young people their amygdala fired with activity at both types of imagery;\nhowever, for elerderly subjects it only fired for positive stimuli.\nShe hypothesises that the old had trained their prefrontal cortex to inhibit the amygdala in the presence of negative stimuli.\n\nA psychological argument for depth \n\nMihaly Csikszentmihalyi came up with Experience Sampling Method where pagers would beep at random times in the day and people would record how they feel.\nThis research helped validate a theory: The best moments usually occur when a person's body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile.\nMihaly called this mental state flow\nHe claims that jobs are much easier to enjoy because they have defined goals and structure compared to free time which requires more effort to structure.\nThis is because our minds are adapted to structure and goal chasing.\nWhen measured empirically people were happier at work and less happy relaxing than they expected.\n\nA philosophical argument for depth \n\nNewport starts by talking about All Things Shining: Reading the Western Classics to Find Meaning in a Secular Age.\nIn the book the writers argue that people have lost reverence for the sacred and meaningful and attribute it to Descartes' skepticism.\nwhere the individual seeking objective truth trumped god and king bestowing truth.\nThey argue that the resulting enlightenment lead to a world where we are the judges of what is meaningful and what is not; leading to nihilism\nIn the book the writers conclude that craftsmanship provides a key reopening the sense of sacredness.\nAny pursuit – be it physical or cognitive – that supports high levels of skill can also generate a sense of sacredness.\nI this chapter Newport is tries to show that one can find the sacred or meaning in deep work.\n\nPart 2 - The Rules \n\nDescribes a rigorous program for transforming your professional life into one centered on depth.\n\nRule 1 - Work Deeply \n\n\nEudaimonia machine \n\nStarts with Newport talking about meeting David Dewane, an architect who was working on what he called the eudaimonia machine;\nA one story building with 5 rooms placed in a line meant to enable the deepest possible work. Something unique to this building is that it has no shared hallway. You have to pass through one room to get to the next.\n\n\nRooms in the eudaimonia machine\n\nGallery - contains examples of deep work produced in the building\nmeant to create a culture of healthy stress and peer pressure\nSalon - access to high quality coffee maybe even a full blown bar\ncreate a mood that hovers between intense curiosity and argumentation\nLibrary - a collection of all the work that has been produced in the building\nhard drive of the machine\nOffice - a standard conference room with a whiteboard and some cubicles with desks\nfor shallow work\nDeep work chambers - places to perform deep work\n\n\n\n\nWillpower \n\nWe have a finite amount of willpower that becomes depleted as we use it\n\n\nWays to hack willpower\n\n\nDecide on your depth philosophy\nHere are a couple of depth philosophies or approaches to deep work:\n\nThe monastic philosophy of deep work\n\nEliminate everything and just do deep work\nthis method attempts to maximize deep efforts by eliminating or radically minimizing shallow obligations\n\nThe bimodal philosophy of deep work scheduling\n\nWorking deeply for a \"season\" then performing shallow tasks.\nThe author cites Jung, Adam Grant (Wharton professor) and the consultants who took a week off as practitioners of this.\nMinimum stretch of deep work in this method is a full day\n\nThe rhythmic philosophy of deep work scheduling\n\nMake deep work a simple regular habit\nCites Brian Chappell who woke up early to work on his dissertation\n\nThe journalistic philosophy of deep work scheduling\n\nTaking the opportunities to perform deep work whenever the opportunity presents itself.\nCites, Walter Issacson who co-authored The Wise Men: Six Friends and the World They Made while on\nsummer vacation and while working a full time job as a writer.\nHe calls it journalistic because journalists are expected to switch to deep work mode at a moment's notice.\nThis is the method Newport adopted when he wrote deep work\n\n\n\n\n\nRitualize \n\nHaving a set of rules to follow before performing deep work.\nCites Darwin et al who had deep work rituals.\nAny effective deep work ritual must address the following:\n\nwhere will you work and how long\nhow you'll work once you start your work\nhow you'll support your work\n\n\nMake grand gestures \n\nHere we try to boost the sense of importance that your mind assigns a given task.\nA high sense of importance reduces your minds instict to proctrastinate and delivers motivation and energy\nNewport cites:\n\nJ.K. Rowling checking into a suite at Balmoral Hotel to finish The Deahtly Hallows.\nBill Gate's think weeks.\nAlan Lightman retreats each summer to an island in Maine to think deeply and recharge\nWillian Shockley locked himself in a hotel room to work on a better design of the transistor\nPeter Shankman finished a manuscript in approx 30 hours on a round trip flight to Japan.\n\n'Sometimes to go deep, you must first go big.'\n\nDon't work alone \n\nHere the writer talks about a hub and spoke model as well as a whiteboard effect.\nDuring the hub one interacts with peer and during the spoke one retreats to perform deep work.\nWhile performing deep work though Newport argues about having a whiteboard effect; in this case not performing deep work alone but pushing each other with a peer will lead into more depth and avoid procrastination.\nHe argues that deep work should happen but the opportunity for serendipitous creativity should also be allowed.\nHe claims that the open office is still not good for deep work as there are distractions but also\nargues that there is value in people from different disciplines mixing.\nHe cites:\n\nMIT building 20\nBell labs\n\n\nExecute like a business \n\nHere we start with the basics of disruption where startups begin with cheap offerings\nat their low end of the market but then over time improve their cheap products just enough to begin stealing high end market share.\nYou find a solution for this when companies target both high income and low income populations.\nHe talks about a disconnect between what and how.\nWe may know what to do but now how to do it.\nHe cites Clayton Christensen author of in The 4 Disciplines of Execution: Achieving Your Wildly Important Goals where\nAndy Groove asked him about how to do something because he knew what he needed to do.\nIn this case Newport knew he needed to adapt depth but didn't know how to do it.\nHe ended up applying the  4DX strategy from the aforementioned book in his own life.\nMakes a fundamental premise that execution is more difficult that strategizing\nThe writer also alludes to consistency over intensity when it comes to achieving lag goals.\n\n\nDiscipline 1: Focus on the wildly important\nThe more you try to do the less you accomplish you must therefore focus on a small number of wildly important and specific goals.\nWith deep work identify a small number of ambitious outcomes to pursue with your deep work hours.\n\n\nDiscipline 2: Act on the lead measures\nOnce you come up with wildly important goals you need to come up with ways to measure success.\nIn 4DX there are two types of metrics:\n\nlag measures: they measure the thing you're ultimately trying to improve.\ne.g customer satisfaction could be what you're trying to improve and customer review scores being the a lag measure.\nProblem is the scores come in too late to change the behavior.\nlead measures: these measure the new behaviors that will drive success on the lag measures.\ne.g. number of customers who receive free samples at a bakery, this you can increase by giving out free samples.\nThey turn your attention to improve behaviors you can directly control the near future that will have a positive impact on your long term goals.\nfor deep work you could define it as the time spent in deep work aimed at your goal\n\n\n\nDiscipline 3: Keep a compelling scoreboard\nKeep a scoreboard of your lead measures in a place where you can see it.\nIn the case of deep work hours you can keep this tally and mark milestones to associate them with deep work hours.\nThis helps motivate and keep on track of the lead measures.\n\n\nDiscipline 4: Create a cadence of accountability\nIn the case of a team there should be regular and frequent meetings to review progress on a wildly important goal\nIn the case of deep work one should have weekly reviews to see what went well or badly,\nwhat caused bad weeks and how to keep good weeks happening in future.\n\n\n\nBe lazy \n\nHere Newport argues for the value of downtime.\nDowntime in this case is time spent not working or thinking deeply and just relaxing, being idle.\nWhy downtime is profitable to a practitioner of deep work:\n\n\nReason 1: Downtime aids insights\nIntroduced UTT (Unconscious Thought Theory): it's better to let your subconscious work through some\nproblems that actively trying to tackle them.\nFor decisions that require the application of strict rules the conscious mind must be involved e.g. actively doing math\nFor decision that involve large amounts of info and multiple vague, and perhaps conflicting constraints the unconscious mind is best e.g. coming up with a proof.\n\n\nReason 2: Downtime helps recharge the energy needed to work deeply\nIntroduces the ART (Attention Restoration Theory) which claims that spending time in nature can improve your ability to concentrate.\nThis is based on the concept of Directed Attention Fatigue.\nTo concentrate requires directed attention which is a finite resource which when exhausted makes it hard to concentrate.\nWalking in the city requires directed attention to stay alive but in nature one allows the replenishment of focused attention.\nIn this case trying to squeeze in a little more work in the evenings reduces your ability to perform deep work the next day.\nYour mind must believe that you are done for work until the next day.\n\n\nReason 3: The work that evening downtime replaces is usually not that important\nThis section is based on the premise that your capacity for deep work per day is limited.\nIn the case of deliberate practice novices spent a max 1hr in a state of depth but elite players averaged about 3.5 hrs.\nIf you're careful about your schedule; you should hit your deep work capacity during your workday.\nTherefore, by evening you're beyond your capacity to work deeply.\nYour night efforts will likely be low value shallow tasks. By deferring these activities you're not missing out on much of importance.\nA key commitment for succeeding with shutting down is having a shutdown ritual.\nA shutdown ritual should ensure incomplete tasks have been reviewed\nZierganik effect: the ability of incomplete tasks to dominate our attention\nTo fix this make a plan on how to complete these tasks that would otherwise haunt you\nSide note: What about people like Elon Musk?\n\n\n\nRule 2 - Embrace Boredom \n\nThis rule is meant to significantly improve your deep work limit.\nThe ability to concentrate intensely is a skill that must be trained.\nThis training involves:\n\nImproving your ability to concentrate intensely.\nOvercoming your desire for distraction.\n\nYour brain get addicted to distraction.\nYou therefore shouldn't engage in distracting things even outside of your workday; let yourself be bored.\n\nDon't take breaks from distraction. Instead take breaks from focus. \n\nHere Newport talks about the Internet sabbath popularized by William Powers in Hamlet's Blackberry.\nThis Internet sabbath involves taking one day a week when we don't use the Internet. It could also be varied to be\n2 months in a year, 2 hours in a day and so forth.\nHe however compares this with being on a diet where we eat healthy on only one day a week.\nThis wouldn't work.\nYou must rewire your brain to resist distracting stimuli\nHe therefore argues for a different approach; this is to schedule (high intensity/low value) distraction.\nTo plan for blocks when to use the Internet. When we have our next \"distraction block\" say in 30 minutess.\nResisting the urge to stay on topic and not go online is an exercise\ntraining your mental muscle to resist distraction.\nImplementing this may be hard to put it in practice here are some considerations:\n\n\n\nThis strategy works even if your job requires lots of Internet use and/or prompt e-mail replies.\n\nJust have more Internet blocks.\nThe total number of Internet blocks doesn't matter as much as\nmaking sure the integrity of your online blocks stays intact.\n\n\n\nRegardless of how you schedule your Internet blocks, you must keep the time outside these blocks absolutely free from Internet use.\n\nThe aforementioned strategy sounds good in theory but what happens when you start an offline\nblock and realize that you forgot to check for a crucial piece of information needed for this block on the Internet?\n\nswitch to a different offline activity\nSchedule your next Internet block to start sooner but at least 5 minutes from the current moment.\nThis at least 5 minute gap is important in that it separates the sensation of wanting to do online with the reward of actually doing so.\nScheduling Internet use at home and at work can further improve your concentration training\nYour attempts outside work to rewire your brain could get undone by your giving into distraction on weekends and in the evenings.\nYou should therefore continue with the scheduling of Internet use.\nYou should keep this up if in an offline block and even waiting in line\n\n\n\n\nWork like Teddy Roosevelt \n\nRoosevelt while at Harvard didn't study for a long time however, he would study with high intensity.\nWhat the writer here advises is to give our tasks very short deadlines which will\nforce us to work at high levels of intensity.\nThis training will aid deep work as deep work is about intensely concentrating.\nHe argues for doing this once a week and increasing the count of these intense work sessions.\nAlso keeping a timer at a place where it's clearly visible to force us to work intensely.\n\nMeditate productively \n\nThis is taking a time when your occupied physically but not mentally\n(e.g walking, showering, commuting) to work on a single well defined mental problem.\nAs with mindfulness meditation, you must continue to bring your\nattention back when it wanders or stalls.\nHe advises that one have 2 or 3 such sessions a week.\nThis practice isn't productive but it increases one's ability to think deeply.\nBe patient with it. It takes time. However to ramp up the speed at which is takes effect:\n\n\nBe wary of distractions and looping\n\n\nDistraction\nRedirect your attention back to the topic at hand.\nAt times your mind might veer off into other seemingly important but off-topic tasks. Resist this urge.\n\n\nLooping\nThis is more subtle and is according to the writer an evolutionary adaptation to avoid expending too much\nenergy. Your mind will avoid going deeper on the topic and keep looping over what is already known.\n\n\n\n\nStructure your deep thinking\nThis point wasn't very clear to me but here's what I got.\nTry to think about the things you need to achieve at the end of productive meditation.\nThen plan it out like first this then I'll get to that etc.\n\n\n\nMemorise a deck of cards \n\nThe writer provides yet another way to train one's attention; learning to memorize a deck of cards.\nHe claims that in learning to memorize the deck of cards you need to keep bringing back your\nattention to the matter at hand which increases your ability to pay attention.\nHe cites Daniel Kilov who was diagnosed with ADD and used to perform poorly in school\nbut once he started learning about managing attention\nwent ahead to graduate from a top Australian University with\nfirst class honors and is a memory athlete.\n\nRule 3 - Quit Social Media \n\nThe writer claims that network tools:\n\nFragment our time and reduce our ability to concentrate\nare overwhelming\n\nKnowing this however we end up feeling like we have only 2 options:\n\nQuit the Internet entirely or take an Internet sabbatical\nAccept our current distracted state as inevitable.\n\nThis section of the book provides a 3rd option\nNewport argues that social media adds very little value to one's life.\nHowever, many have adapted an any benefit mindset this includes\nfinding any benefit as sufficient for justifying the use of social media.\n\nThe any benefit approach to network tool selection \n\nYou're justified to use a network tool if you can identify any possible benefit to its use,\nor anything you might miss out on if you don't use it.\nThe problem with this is that it ignores all the drawbacks of something.\nHe argues that we should see network tools as just another set of tools that are a means to an end.\nYou should select and use carefully your tools as a knowledge worker. He calls this the craftsman approach to tool selection.\nCites Forrest Pritchard, a farmer, who found it better to buy hay than grow grass on his land\nand use a hay baler (he actually sold his) to compact it and make hay for feeding cows in the winter when grazing is impossible.\nForrest in this case considered all the costs as well as the opportunity cost of making\nhay in the winter when he could've been doing something else.\n\nThe craftsman approach to tool selection \n\nIdentify core factors that determine success and happiness in your professional and personal life.\nAdopt a tool only if the pros outweigh the cons in regards to the factors.\nBelow are strategies to help you evaluate network tools.\n\n\nApply the law of the vital few to your Internet habits\nThe law of the vital few: In many settings 80% of a given effect is due to just 20% of the possible causes.\nIf we assumed that this holds for most goals in one's life.\nThis would help find the 20% of the activities needed to achieve said goals.\nSeeing how network tools affect these goals should be a big consideration in how we use said tools.\nMoreover, if you use limited time and attention on other activities\nespecially low value they take from the 20% that would have the highest impact.\nConversely, by taking the time consumed by low impact activities and\nreinvesting in high impact activities you end up more successful in your goal.\nIn this case outline a few high level goals and activities that enable the achievement of this goal.\nProfessionally for Newport this would be\nThe goals should be high level but not too generic e.g \"do better research…\" is too general and \"finish paper on …\" is too specific.\nA few goals\n\nBe a better researcher\nBe a better teacher to his students\nBe an effective mentor to his students\n\nSupporting activities would be:\n\nRegularly read and understand cutting edge results in his field\n\nIn this case he would assess a tool against these.\nCites Malcolm Gladwell et al.\n\n\nQuit social media\nCites Ryan Nicodemus, a man who decided to declutter his life by packing what he owned in boxes.\nHe then went on with life only unpacking something when he needed it.\nAfter a week he noticed that he didn't need a majority of his stuff and go rid of it.\nNewport argues that people hold onto stuff with the thought that they might need it someday.\nThis same logic is held when it comes to social media.

Let the name not fool you, this server is supposed to work with all WAI compliant haskell web applications such as yesod, spock, scotty applications among others.\nMy mentor has been Michael Snoyman. I've also been working closely with Michael Sloan and Daniel Beskin.\nIt started on a high note. I was added to the FP Complete github organisation. That had me very excited because of the kind of people who are in that organisation plus it's THE HASKELL organisation in my opinion. So that's the social aspect. Let's talk programming.\nide-backend \n\nSo FP Complete recently released a library that acts as a wrapper around the GHC API, that is, ide-backend (I wrote about it in an earlier post).\nThis library was extracted from the online FP Complete haskell ide. It was therefore still aimed at working  a cleint - server model where the client and server are on different boxes. The client (the package depending on ide-backend) had to explicitly specify the files to be copied from the cleint to the server. This worked in the FP Complete use case but wouldn't work in our use case.\nSo we had to make it work in a local environment. This was my first task.\nThe aim here was to enable automatic source file (as well as data files and everything else) discovery by ide-backend so that it can submit these files for compilationa by GHC.\nTo do this, one has to specify that they want to use ide-backend with a local working directory under configLocalWorkingDir in defaultSessionConfig. configLocalWorkingDir is a value of type Maybe FilePath. It defaults to (Nothing :: Maybe FilePath) and has ide-backend working in a client-server environment. When configLocalWorkingDir is set it uses the given file path as the place it will look for source files, data files and everything in between.\nFunctionality for ide-backend to work in a non-server environment was finally merged in this commit onwards on github. It's not yet on the hackage version of ide-backend as of writing this post but it will be pushed soon enough.\nyesod-devel \n\nThen came the challenge of yesod-devel. This is the \"client\" in our case that depends on ide-backend. \nQuite honestly the fact is that ide-backend is the one doing most of the heavy lifting while yesod-devel coordinates everything.\nThe objectives of yesod-devel are:\n\nAutomatic source and data file discovery.\nLoad code\nCompile to bytecode\nRun the code\nRead environment variables\nGrab compiler error messages and display them on the browser\nListening for changes in the current working directory\nAutomatic code reloading and recompilation\nPerform reverse proxying for the web application\n\n","id":"https://njagi.me/google-summer-of-code-2015/","title":"Google Summer of Code (2015)"},"https://njagi.me/google-summer-of-code-2019-final-submission/":{"body":"The Google Summer of Code for 2019 is coming to a close. I've been working on\nthe Graphite project aimed at creating a variation graph tool under the\nOpen Bioinformatics Foundation.\nGenome Graphs \n\nI shall give an overview of genome graphs; for a more thorough introduction, I\nadvise reading  On a reference pan-genome model or my very own\nAn Introduction to Variation Graphs.\nVariation graphs are a class of genome graphs that, among other things,\nmaintain:\n\npath information—a full walk within the graph along the edges\na strong mapping between nodes on the graph and their positions on the\nreference\n\nAll this with the main aim of representing genomic variation.\nCurrently genomes are represented as a consensus; for example, here's part of\nchromosome 20 of the human genome:\nTGGGAGAGAACTGGAACAAGAACCCAGTGCTCTTTCTGCTCTACCCACTGACCCATCCTCTCACGCATCATACACCCATA\nCTCCCATCCACCCACCTTCCCATTCATGCATTCACCCATTCACCCACCTTCCATCCATCTACCATCCACCACGTACCTAC\nACTCCCATCTACCATCCAACCACATTTCCATTCACCCATCCTCCCATCCATCAACCCTCCAATCCACCACCCACAGACCT\nTCCCATCCATTCATTTACCCATCCACATATTCACCCACCCTCCCATCCATCCATCTACTGTCTATCACCTACTCATTTTC\n...\n\nHowever, variation does exist on this chromosome between individuals.\nTo demonstrate, when a single file of variation data is \"applied\" to it we end\nup with a graph that can be represented as in the  below zoomed in section of\nchromosome 20.\n\nNot all graphs are linear like the one above; in fact, the kind of graphs we're\nhoping to generate soon will have many breaks and will look pretty jumbled up.\nThe amount of variation within and between genomes depends on a lot of factors\nincluding but not limited to the organism(s) whose genomes are studying and how\nevolutionarily distant the genomes we are comparing are (pan-genomes).\nReference Bias \n\nThe reference being a consensus introduces a problem known as reference bias;\nwhich is analogous to a false negative during read mapping, that is, claiming\nthat a variation does not exist where it actually exists.\nResearch has shown an improvement in read mapping of short read data when\nshort reads are mapped to a reference graph instead of a reference consensus.\nCurrently, graphite shows that we can generate a graph from a reference and\nvariation data and progressively update it; not far from what Heng Li theorizes\nin: On a reference pan-genome model.\nWe plan on supporting the generation of graphs from short and long-read data on\nits own (de novo), you can track its progress under\nthe alignment project board.\nWhy Racket? \n\nYou may wonder why Graphite is written in Racket yet the project name is\nAdd Variant Graph (VG) support to BioD.\nGenome graphs have been theorized and written about for a while now but there\nare only a few tools that implement them and there has been even much less use\nby bioinformaticians.\nWe decided to build something people can use over just adding variation graph\nsupport to BioD believing that it would've taken me longer to write something\npeople could use in D.\nWhy Racket Not Another Language or Lisp? \n\nI have experience in functional programming and particularly\nprofessional experience with LISPs, I could, therefore, move much faster in it.\nRacket is a good LISP to use when working in an unfamiliar domain because it has\na straightforward build system compared to the overhead of the JVM and\nleiningen in the most popular LISP, Clojure does and has an\neasy to use C/C++ FFI, languages used in a lot of Bioinformatics\napplications and libraries. Being untyped and programming in LISP being\nREPL driven also helps to venture into unfamiliar territory.\nRacket has immutability in a lot, if not all, of its data structures which\nalso helps with all the data manipulation we would have to do. Finally, Racket\nalso implements core programming concepts elegantly compared to many other\nlanguages for example with its hygienic macros.\nThis shouldn't make the D community feel betrayed because given what\nwe know now, we can always go back and reimplement either all or part of\nGraphite in D, especially for the possible performance improvements.\nDone \n\nFor the fine detail install and set up Graphite as instructed in the README\nand run graphite --help.\nUnderlying Graph Representation \n\nWe implemented the graph as an association hash table. I went into more detail\non how it's built and the rationale behind certain choices in\nCreating the Initial Variation Graph and Justifying SHA256 in Graphite.\nConstruct \n\nGraphite allows you to build an initial graph out of a reference in\nFASTA format and a VCF file.\nIn the example below I output a serialized graph but you can output .dot or\n.gfa.\n./bin/graphite construct \\\n -o rsv1.gra \\\n -f gra \\\n data/RSV/refererence_and_vcf_file/9465113.fa data/RSV/refererence_and_vcf_file/H_3801_22_04.freebayes.vcf\nUpdate \n\nFormally, progressive construction. Graphite lets the user update a serialized\ngraph generated via construct.\nIn the update, it takes serialized graph .gra and variation data in VCF.\nExample:\n./bin/graphite update \\\n -o rsv2.dot \\\n -f dot \\\n rsv1.gra data/RSV/refererence_and_vcf_file/fake_H_3801_22_04.freebayes.vcf\nView \n\nGraphite allows you to generate graphs in\n\ndot for visualization via GraphViz\ngfa for visualization with tools like bandage\ngra a serialized graph, it can't be visualized.\n\nUsing update and view, one can visualize changes introduced by different VCF\nfiles as of writing this.\nThe view command takes a serialized graph .gra, an output format, and an output\nfile as arguments.\nExample:\n./bin/graphite view \\\n -o rsv1.dot \\\n -f dot \\\n rsv1.gra\nTo Do \n\nLook at the Graphite project boards for further detail.\nPartial Order Alignment \n\nThis would allow for aligning reads to a graph or against each other bypassing\nthe consensus reference.\nFor now, graphite can only align against strings (however this functionality\nisn't exposed because it's not ready yet) mainly because it only\nstores forward edges which makes it hard to implement\nPartial Order Alignment (POA) which strictly depends on backward edges.\nThe short term options are adding a pre-processing\nstep to generate backward edges or using Racket's FFI to call spoa or gssw.\nIn the medium to long term Graphite's nodes should support backward edges which\nwould, on top of assisting with POA, allow for encoding more complex mutations\nsuch as inversions.\nSearch \n\nThis involves having a kmer, the substring of a genome, and searching for its\nmost likely position in the graph.\nI have multiple problems with this as of now such as completely not finding\nkmers at all or having them point to the wrong location.\nComplementarity \n\nGraphite doesn't support complementarity (only supports the positive strands)\ntherefore searching for a kmer in the negative strand wouldn't even work.\nI am evaluating different ways of implementing complementarity.\nA Graph Extension of the Burrows-Wheeler Transform \n\nSearch doesn't work for some strings and even worse the method I am using to\nbuild the index is not ideal. Currently, I am building the FM index via a\nBurrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) which is in turn built from rotating the given\nstring, this is far from ideal.\nA better strategy I am considering is:\n\ngenerate a suffix tree via Ukkonen's algorithm\ntraverse the suffix tree via a depth-first search to build a suffix array\nuse the suffix array to generate a BWT\n\nI could then complement the BWT and then generate the FM index and therefore\nget fast queries onto the graph.\nI believe this to be the basic idea behind\nA Graph Extension of the Positional Burrows-Wheeler Transform and its Applications.\nAdding a Metadata Field \n\nWe could add a metadata field to the nodes which will allow for something\nlike inbuilt annotation support.\nMiscellaneous \n\nAnother feature not related to Bioinformatics but is surprisingly lacking in Racket\nis to extend cmdline to have command-line options as is described in\nMulti-command-line in Racket.\nTo reiterate, you can look at these 3 other posts regarding Graphite:\n\nAn Introduction to Variation Graphs\nCreating the Initial Variation Graph\nJustifying SHA256 in Graphite\n\nAcknowledgements \n\nI'd like to acknowledge the contribution of the following organizations and people.\nSponsors:\n\nGoogle Summer of Code\nOpen Bioinformatics Foundation\n\nmy mentors:\n\nGeorge Githinji\nPjotr Prins\n\nand those who weren't my mentors but helped along the way by offering\ntechnical advice, testing graphite, reading the code or reviewing the blog posts:\n\nAlan Orth\nErik Garrison\nJason Rogena\nKenneth Gitere\nKevin Murimi\n\n","id":"https://njagi.me/google-summer-of-code-2019-final-submission/","title":"Google Summer of Code 2019—Final Submission"},"https://njagi.me/how-to-apply-a-patch-quickly/":{"body":"So you really should read more on this but of you are in a hurry.\n\nYou should get your source then copy the .patch or .diff into the root of the source file.

going into it.\nFeel free to skip a sentence, paragraph or even section if you're familiar with a topic.\nGenome sequencing \n\nA genome is the entire genetic code of an organism. While computational data\nis  represented in binary form, ones, and zeros, biochemical data is represented\nby nitrogenous bases that seem to stick out of a DNA or RNA molecule/strand\nabbreviated A, T, C, and G for DNA and A, G, C and U for RNA.\nWe care about RNA because some viruses have RNA and not\nDNA.\nIf this is confusing, you can think of a strand of DNA or RNA as a thread  with\nknots where each knot is a base.\nA sequence is an ordering of something.\nA programming analog is a sequence vs a collection. Sequences are ordered,\nfor example lists, and therefore have the potential for a next and a previous\nelement while collections are just data thrown together, for example, a\ndictionary or a set.\nGenome sequencing (or sequencing a genome) therefore, is determining the\norder of bases in all of the DNA or RNA in an organism. What makes this easy is\nthat all the cells in an individual organism have the same DNA so we can\nget all the DNA in an organism from a single cell.\nIn practice, however, we can't work with a single cell due to its size.\nIgnore chromosomes, haplotypes and other things you may know about DNA for now.\nTo determine the sequence of bases in an entire genome of an organism we focus\non only one of the alleles (a haplotype) and only one strand of the\ndouble helix.\nSince 2005 we've used methods broadly categorized\nunder Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) to perform genome sequencing.\nThere are two main ways of performing NGS:\n\nShear the DNA into small fragments, sequence those and try to build back the\noriginal sequence. An analogy that’s used is shredding a newspaper article\nthen trying to recreate it.\nRun the DNA strand like a train would run through a tunnel through a pore\nand read the sequence of bases.\nThere are other methods of reading entire strands of DNA but they don't matter\nin this context.\n\nAs you would expect, each method has its drawbacks and advantages.\nWhat we get out of the machine that does the actual sequencing of DNA is called\na read and reads have to be aligned and\nassembled2.\nAlignment involves stacking reads on top of each other and assembling is the\ngreater process that involves alignment, algorithmically choosing the best\nalignment and determining what the original sequence was.\nThere are two broad categories of assembly4:\n\nDe-novo assembly: this is where we sequence a genome that has never been\nsequenced before\nMapping assembly: this is sequencing an organism’s unique code despite\nhaving the general sequence for the species. What you get from services\nlike 23andMe.\n\nThe reference genome \n\nA reference genome is a consensus sequence that accepted as the genome of a\nspecies2. It’s stored as one long sequence of characters/bases.\nYou may wonder how we can have a known genome of an entire species when every\nindividual has a unique genetic code or how humans are 99% chimp.\nWell, the answer is that genetic code of most organisms\nis similar and this similarity increases as we narrow down taxonomically.\nWhen we say that a human is closer to a chimp than a monkey what we mean is\nthat we can observe greater variation between the genomes of the two, man+chimp vs monkey, than man vs chimp alone.\nThis isn't actual math but may help clear things up.\nvariation(combine_genomes(man, chimp), monkey) &gt; variation(man, chimp)\n\nVariation in genomes \n\nHowever, there are still genomic differences and they should not be ignored.\nThe ignoring of differences is implicit in a linear reference.\nA better way to describe them is to say that the differences are segregating within the population.\nWe may also want to carry out a comparison between species or between related\nspecies which is done in pangenomics.\nDNA has sections which are identical between individuals (conserved regions), and\nthe number of these  sections grow as we narrow down taxonomically and there are\nsections which vary between individuals, for example, the short sequence repeats\nthat are compared in paternity testing.\nGraph theory is an area in math that can help us understand variable\nregions within genomes. The idea of representing genomes as graphs isn’t new,\nhowever, the low number of tools like vg which apply graph theory to genomics\nand the little that we know about genomes has been a drawback.\nGraphs \n\nA graph is a series of vertices (also known as nodes) and edges.\n\nFor genome graphs, we focus on directed acyclic graphs.\nA walk in a directed graph is traversal from one node to another through an\nedge, for example, a to b to d or a to c to d.\n\nThe current state of affairs \n\nOnce the reference genome of an organism has been determined, it is stored in\nfasta format which contains the sequence and metadata. Moving forward, anyone\nsequencing the same species aligns against this reference. Differences that occur\nin less than 1% of the reads are usually thrown out;\nthe ones that aren’t thrown out don’t help to update the reference but are stored\nin Variant Call Format (VCF) which contains the variation data and their\npositions plus metadata. These VCF files are spread out amongst researchers and\naid in the particular thing being researched but generally don’t contribute in\nand of themselves to the general genomic body of knowledge.\nHowever, every once in awhile the reference is updated but not on a fixed\nschedule2.\nIt’s for this reason that the variation graph would be a good way of\nrepresenting the reference. There is research that confirmed that short\nreads align better to the variation graph than to a linear reference3.\nGraphs and genomes \n\nGraphs that are applied to genomes are generally called genome graphs.\nHowever, there are two more specific categories which are sequence graphs and\nvariation graphs.\nAs an example assume that we zoom on a hypothetical reference: \"ACTGAATTTGTA\"\nVariationPositionAlternative\nVariation12GGGA\nVariation24C\n\nWe could recursively insert Variation1 at position 2 and Variation2 at position\n4 to generate the graph below:\n\n(generated using graphite and my current fork of graph)\nIn this case, a single walk would represent a possible genome. Compared to the\nreference, this variation information is maintained and the graph still holds\nthe data that was in reference.\nSequence Graphs \n\nThese are graphs with sequence labels on the nodes or edges.\nSequence graphs or equivalent structures have been used previously to represent\nmultiple sequences that contain shared differences or ambiguities in a single\nstructure. Related structures used in genome assembly which collapse long\nrepeated sequences, so the same nodes are used for different regions of the\ngenome include the De Bruijn graph5. Graphs to represent genetic variation\nhave previously been used for microbial genomes &amp; localized regions of the human\ngenome such as the major histocompatibility complex.\nVariation Graphs \n\nA variation graph is a sequence graph together with a set of paths representing\npossible sequences from a population. However, what makes it so unique is it's\ntight mapping between the graph and the reference.\nVariation graphs and RSV \n\nHuman orthopneumovirus, formerly known as Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV),\nis a single-stranded RNA virus and a good candidate for exploration using the\nvariation graph because viruses don’t have proofreading in their genetic code.\nProofreading is a process in which the cell ensures that it has copied the\ngenetic code correctly in preparation for cell division. Without proofreading,\nerrors will be commonplace leading to high mutation rates.\nAnother advantage is the size of its genome; the reference stands at\n15,206 bases which translate to 15206 bytes or 14.8 KB of memory.\nGenerating a variation graph \n\nAs of writing this, graphite can’t generate a graph out of reads alone\n(perform an alignment). It supports a reference in fasta and a single VCF file.\nI'll detail the algorithm in a later post but the gist of it is this:\n\nLoad the reference into memory or read a chunk of it if you wish\nLoad your variation data from a VCF\nOrganize variations into structs containing\n\nvariation\nposition\nreference\n\n\nSort the variations in ascending order by position\nUsing a right fold function - for support of streams\n\nfold through the list of variations\nAt each variation position split the reference and create a list of:\n\nthe string to the left\nstring to the right\na list of the variation and the base that was there originally (this will be a list of lists)\n\n\n\n\nCreate directed graph out of the list of lists generated by the fold\n* '((a b) (a c)) to become a node with edges from a to b and c to be and a-&gt;b and a-&gt;b\n\nVariation \n\nA variation is a struct of position and sequence.\nI’m using the racket graph library graph to generate a graph out of the nested\nlists and treating the graph as a “dynamic tree”.\nWe then rely on graph to generate an unweighted directed graph through\nunweighted-graph/directed.\nWe export the graph in dot format and visualize via graphviz. Serialization isn’t implemented yet.\nReferences \n\n\nAdam M.

The keys of the hash table are SHA256 hashes of the concatenation of: the\nsequence, a plus symbol(+), and the offset.\n\nHashes also grant us outgoing edge representations, constant time lookups for\nqueries of known sequence and position, and eliminate duplicates.\nComputational Cost of Hashing \n\nWe have to compute a hash to uniquely identify each variation and we have to\nstore each hash twice: first, as a key in the adjacency hash table; and second,\nas  a field in the variation structure value.\nWe must therefore examine the time and space costs of hashing.\nTime \n\nI couldn't find any useful cost data on either the SHA-2 racket implementation\nor SHA-2, the algorithm itself, but being a string algorithm you can assume\nit works in O(n) time, n being the length of the string being hashed.\nThis isn't worrying because hashing is a one off cost which has proved\ninexpensive with the current variation data-set.\nSpace \n\nThis is more of a concern because we expect graphs to grow with time.\nA SHA 256 hash takes the same amount of space as a 32 characters string\n(8*32=256). Therefore, for variations with sequences fewer than 32 nucleotides,\nwe store a hash that is larger than the variation we are hashing\n(ignoring the plus symbol and offset). This is exemplified in SNP data.\nGraph Comparison \n\nA nice effect from hashing is that we can compare simple graphs derived from the\nsame reference by comparing their hashes. It goes without saying that there are\nbetter or more general ways to perform graph comparison.\nProbability of Collision \n\nWe can approximate the probability of a collision using the function\nP(n) = 1-e-n2/(2d). Where n is the sample size and d\nis the total number of \"buckets\".\nFor more about calculating this probability check out Birthday Problem Approximations.\nTo avoid a collision we need to make sure that our variations are fewer than the\nsquare root of the bucket size—the point at which we get 0.5 chance of having\ntwo different strings sharing the same hash.\nThink of it as the halfway point in a binomial distribution where past 0.5 we\nconsider a collision to have occurred. In reality the halfway point occurs\nabove the square root but it's still an easy way of verifying that your\nsample size is within a safe range.\nHere's a Racket function derived from the one above that I used to approximate\ncollision probability.\n(define (probability-of-collision  d n)\n  (- 1 (/ 1 (exp (/ (expt n 2) (* 2 d))))))\nThe Birthday Paradox \n\nUsing the approximation function above, we estimate that for every group of 23\nrandomly selected people (n=23, d=356), the probability that two of them share a\nbirthday is 0.5; and in a sample of 357 people (n=357, d=356), the probability\nthat two of them share a birthday is 1.\n\nSHA 256 \n\nFor SHA 256 the halfway probability of a hash collision occurs at a point above\n2128\n\nThis may be hard to interpret because exponential functions grow very quickly.\nHere's the Racket code I used to generate these plots:\n#lang racket\n\n(require plot)\n\n(define (probability-of-collision  d x)\n  (- 1 (/ 1 (exp (/ (expt x 2) (* 2 d))))))\n\n(define (label-point-at x y)\n  (let* ([fn (lambda (v) (if (&gt; v (expt 10 6)) 'exponential 'positional))]\n        [x* (~r #:precision 4 #:notation fn x)]\n        [y* (~r #:precision 4 y)])\n    (list (vrule x 0 y #:style 'long-dash)\n          (hrule y 0 x #:style 'long-dash)\n          (point-label (vector x y) (format \"x = ~a    y = ~a\" x* y*)))))\n\n(define (plot-probability-of-collison bucket-size label [halfway-probability #f])\n  (let ([g (if halfway-probability halfway-probability (sqrt bucket-size))]\n        [bucket-size-root (sqrt bucket-size)]\n        [fn               ((curry probability-of-collision) bucket-size)])\n    (parameterize ([plot-x-transform  log-transform]\n                   [plot-width 750])\n      (plot\n       (list\n        (function fn 1  bucket-size #:label label)\n        (label-point-at g (fn g)))\n       #:x-label \"Sample size\"\n       #:y-label \"Probability of collision\"))))\n\n(plot-probability-of-collison 365 \"Birthday\" 23)\n\n(plot-probability-of-collison (expt 2 256) \"SHA 256\")\nThe Birthday Attack \n\nIn the birthday attack, an attacker when given a hash, guesses a string that\nwill generate the same hash. If there no collisions the attacker would have to\ncome up with the exact string that generated the hash. If there are collisions\nthe attacker could get away with guessing a different string.\nThis is out of the scope of this post but birthday attack and\nbirthday problem wikipedia pages can provide further reading.\nThere's also this lecture on YouTube from the Coursera cryptography course\nCryptography generic birthday attack (collision resistance).\nApplied to Variation \n\nFor a 256 bit hash we have 2256 as our bucket size.\nWe then have the square root of that being\n2(256/2) = 2128 approximately 3.4*1038 as\nthe sample size below which we have 0.5 chance of collision.\nFor context, the human genome is approximately 3*106 (billion)\nnucleotides long, which is much smaller than  3.4*1038.\nViruses have even shorter genomes, ranging in kilo (thousand) nucleotides,\nfor example, the RSV genome is approximately 15*103 nucleotides long\nwhich is even shorter than 3.4*1038 when compared to the human genome.\nThe number of variations we expect in these genomes is therefore much smaller\nthan 2128. As a side note, SHA256 is\nused to uniquely identify bitcoin which there are a lot of.\nHow Much Variation Can Actually Occur? \n\nThe short answer is: we don't know for sure but we can estimate its upper bound.\nGiven we look at genomes that are in the same species or quasi species we expect\n99% similarity.\n\n\n1% of the human genome would be approximately 3*104 (thirty thousand)\nnucleotides long.\n\n\n1% of RSV would be approximately 15*103 (a hundred and fifty)\nnucleotides long.\n\n\nThis is the space within which we expect the variation to occur.\nGranted, we still don't know just how much variation could occur, which in\nreality would depend on the organism, we have reduced the problem space by\norders of magnitude below 2128 making SHA256 look really good.\nI expect the biggest problem with SHA256 to come from the space cost of\nhashing in terms of both disk and/or memory.\n","id":"https://njagi.me/justifying-sha256-in-graphite/","title":"Jusifying SHA256 in Graphite"},"https://njagi.me/logicomix/":{"body":"Graphic novel on the history of and a gentle intro to some of the biggest ideas in logic, math and modern philosophy.\nIt's really not a comic and it's a great read.\n\nIt's a lot of things in one:\n\nA story about the conflict between ideal rationality and the unchanging flawed fabric of reality.\nA tragedy with logicians as heroes\n\nAuthors \n\nHaven't looked much into:\n\nApostolos Doxiadis\nChristos H.

It did other things well like fetch album art and looking preety instead of playing music when I wanted it to, also no scrobbling yet :-(. Though I will use it as soon it goes stable and hopefully stick to it.\nBottomline, I've found home and if by any chance I ditch Gnome 3 I'll probably look for something close to what I with is xmonad on xorg but with wayland instead of xorg. Hope I get to try wayland soon.\nFun times :-)\n","id":"https://njagi.me/my-gnome-3-experience/","title":"My Gnome 3 Experience"},"https://njagi.me/notes-on-idesession/":{"body":"These are literally notes I wrote down while reading on ide-backend and I chose to turn into a blog post.\nWhat is IdeSession? \n\nThis a module from the package ide-backend from FP Complete that provides an interface to ide-backend.\nAs far as I can tell it is the sole interface to ide-backend.\nI choose think of it as the sole API to ide-backend.\nWhat is ide-backend? \n\nThere's a blog post from FP Complete explaining what ide-backend is: ide-backend blog post\nI'll summarize in my own words.\nFP Complete have been creating an IDE for haskell and in this IDE they have code that they use for communication between the IDE and GHC (the most widely used haskell compiler).\nDuncan Coutts, Edsko de Vries, and Mikolaj Konarski implemented a library that would act as a wrapper around the GHC API from this this code.\nIt's this library (ide-backend) that is being used by people in the haskell community as general a wrapper around the GHC API.\nCopied and pasted from the ide-backend blog post. The functions of ide-backend are:\n\nCompiling code\nGet compile error messages\nSubmit updated code for recompilation\nExtract type information\nFind usage locations for identifiers - works for both local and top level identifiers\nRun generated bytecode\nProduce optimized executables\n\nIdeSession \n\nYou may want to read official IdeSession documentation.\nIdeSession is centered around:\n\nA single threaded IDE session.\nOperations for updating the session (changes in files, data, compiler parameters etc.)\nRunning querries given the current state of the session.\n\n\nNote that everything going on here is taking place in a single threaded environment.\n\nInteraction with the compiler \n\nThis interface is rather sequential; in part because we are dealing with files and data which are mutable.\nThe general pattern of interation with the compiler is as follows:\n\nUpdate phase (update source files, data et cetera).\nCompile phase\nQuery phase (query the compiler on matters regarding the code).\nRun phase\n\nUpdate phase: We don't directly mutate the files since we don't want to end up in a situation where ide-backend has a different state of files and data while our client has a different state of the files and data. However, we describle the changes we want to make to the files and let ide-backend effect them. That is, give ide-backend, via IdeSession, the new state of the files.\nCompile phase: We apply the relevant updates and invoke the compiler. It incrementally compiles some modules. This may take a while therefore we want progress information.\nQuery phase: After compilation we collect info related to the compilation: source errors, list of successfully loaded modules et cetera.\nRun phase: Regardless of compilation results; we may want to run code from a certain module, interact with the code, interrupt its execution.\nIn haskell we follow types so naturally there are types associated with each of these phases.\n\nIdeSession: Query phase - This is the default mode (we start here because at the start the files are in some state).\nIdeSessionUpdate: Update phase - Accumulate updates.\nProgress: Compile phase - Progress info.\nRunActions: Run phase - For handles on the running code, through which one can interact with the code.\n\nAdditional notes. \n\nManaging and mutating files in the source directory.\n\nTrust the session. Trust IdeSession.\n\nIn this environment we should coordinate updating and changing source files through IdeSession.\nIde session manages files in the source directory. This is important because we don't want the client and ide-backend have different versions of the files.\nAll file changes and file reading must be done via the session (sequenced relative to other session state changes).\nThe session will manage the files carefully including the case of exceptions and things going awry.\nThe caller needn't duplicate file state.\nThe caller should be able to:\n\nPut files into the session\nApply updates to files via the session\nExtract files at any time before the session is closed.\n\nMorally pure querries.\nPurity:\n\nThe property of a function to always gives the same output given the same input.\nThe property of a function not to have side effects.\n\nIn this case we want to regard the compiler as a pure function disregarding the side effects part of purity because we have a lot of IO going on here.\nIt should always be the case that we can throw away all the compilation results and recover them just from the file state and user parameters.\nIn case of warnings: Traditionally compilers show warnings for the modules they compile skipping warning for modules they didn't have to recompile. This however doesn't match the pure function principle of same results for the same parameters. So IdeSession provides purity in cases such as these.\n\nSo we try to maintain the compiler as:\ncompiler (modules, args, env) -&gt; (object code, compiler warnings, errors....)\n\nPersistent and transitory state.\nThe persistent state regards:\n\nThe source files\nData files\nUser supplied arguments for compilation.\n\nInternally there is a lot of cached and transitory state. In memory or on disk; none of these persist in the case of a fatal error; for example, they are wiped before shutdown and only the source and data files persit in case of a power failure.\nIt should be possible to drop all transitory state and recover (somewhat) as long as the original session value is available. The restartSession function serves this purpose.\n","id":"https://njagi.me/notes-on-idesession/","title":"Notes on IdeSession"},"https://njagi.me/object-oriented-programming-in-c/":{"body":"These notes assume you're familiar with functions, classes, inheritance and\nobjects. This would be a good read for those taking INF 332 but a C++ text\nbook or this wikibooks article would be better.\nI also use a lot of example code  so that it becomes easy for you (and me later)\nto follow along.\nDefinitions \n\nData member: (attribute) a variable accessible from within the class or\nglobal within the class.\nMember function: (method) a function in a class.\nAbstract class: A class containing at least one pure virtual function.\nGetter: (accessor) a function used to access or get the value held by a\nprivate data member. These variable names often start with get.\nSetter: (modifier) a function used to modify or set the value held by a\nprivate data member. These variable names often start with set.\nStruct vs Class: There are two ways to define a class in C++.\nUsing class and using struct.\nWhen using class all that is within the braces is private by default unless\notherwise specified.\nWhen using struct all that is within the braces is public unless otherwise\nspecified.\nthis It's a special pointer used to refer to the current object at the time.\nTo use it dereference the pointer like so this -&gt; memFunction() or\n(*this).memFunction() to call member functions of the object itself.\nIn a human analogy it's a pronoun the object can use to refer to itself;\namong people this would be \"me\".\nBase class: a class from which other classes are derived/inherit from.\nChild class: a class that was derived from another, that class will then be\nits parent class.\nParent class: A parent class is the closest class that we derived from to\ncreate the one we are referencing as the child class.\nThe one right above in the inheritance hierarchy.\nAccess Labels \n\nThese are private, public and protected.\nThey are used within classes to set access permissions for the members in that\nsection of the class.\nThey are also used for base classes to specify how you want the base class\ninherited as shown in the table below.\npublic: This label indicates any members within the 'public' section can be\naccessed freely anywhere a declared object is in scope.\nprivate: Members defined as private are only accessible within the class\ndefining them, or friend classes. Usually the domain of member variables and\nhelper functions.\nIt's often useful to begin putting functions here and then moving them to the\nhigher access levels as needed so to reduce complexity.\nprotected: The protected label has a special meaning to inheritance,\nprotected members are accessible in the class that defines them and in classes\nthat inherit from that base class, or friends of it.\nDuring inheritance things may change slightly as shown in this table.\nHow things were in the parent class in terms of access lables may not be so in\nthe child class.\nBy type of inheritance I mean:\n\nclass childClass: private parentClass is private inheritance\nclass childClass: protected parentClass is protected inheritance\nclass childClass: public parentClass is public inheritance\n\nThe following table indicates how the attributes are inherited in the three\ndifferent types of inheritance:\ntype of inheritanceprivateprotectedpublic\nPrivate inheritanceThe member is inaccessible.The member is private.The member is private.\nProtected inheritanceThe member is inaccessible.The member is protectedThe member is protected\nPublic inheritanceThe member is inaccessible.The member is protectedThe member is public\n\nTable copied entirely from the wikibooks article\nConstructors \n\nA constructor is a special member function that is called whenever a new\ninstance of a class is created.\nThe compiler calls the  constructor after the new object has been allocated in\nmemory, and converts that \"raw\" memory into a proper, typed object\n(typed here means the class becomes a type of the same level with int, string\nand so forth).\nA constructor is used to assign values to the data members that the creator of\nthe class choses.\nIf you don't declare a constructor the compiler will impicitly make one for you.\nThe constructor is declared much like a normal member function but it:\n\nDoesn't have a type annotation meaning it doesn't start with the name of a\ntype such as int or string.\nHas to have the same name as the class.\nHas no return value (Meaning it also has no return statement).\n\nThe constructor may or may not have arguments.\nA constructor that does not take arguments is called a default constructor,\nwhile a constructor that takes argument(s) is a non-default constructor.\nOverloading: This is the ability to create multiple methods of the same name\nbut with different implementations.\nCalls to an overloaded function will run a specific implementation of that\nfunction appropriate to the context of the call, allowing one function call to\nperform different tasks depending on context.\nSo let's rewrite this in a way that combines constructors and contructor\noverloading.\nDon't focus on what the code in the constructors does since I haven't yet\ncovered it.\nHowever, take note that the constructors were called depending on the arguments\nthat the objects passed to them.\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\nusing namespace std;\n\nclass employee {\n\n  int emp_num;\n  string emp_name;\n\npublic:\n  employee () { cout &lt;&lt; \"Default constructor of employee ran.\" &lt;&lt; endl; }\n\n  employee (string name, int num): emp_num (num), emp_name (name) {\n    cout &lt;&lt; \"Employee \" &lt;&lt; this -&gt; getName()\n         &lt;&lt;\" created. With number \" &lt;&lt; this -&gt; getNum()\n         &lt;&lt; endl;\n  }\n\n  employee (int num, string name): emp_num (num), emp_name (name) {\n    cout &lt;&lt; \"Employee \" &lt;&lt; this -&gt; getName()\n         &lt;&lt; \" created. With number \" &lt;&lt; this -&gt; getNum()\n         &lt;&lt; endl;\n  }\n\n  string getName() { return emp_name; }\n  int getNum() { return emp_num; }\n};\n\nint main() {\n  employee jack; // It's not \"objectName ()\" but \"objectName\". No empty brackets.\n  employee mo (123, \"Nikki\");\n  employee jackie (\"Jackson\", 254);\n  return 0;\n}\n\n/*\n   Output:\n\n   Default constructor of employee ran.\n   Employee Nikki created. With number 123\n   Employee Jackson created. With number 254\n*/\n\n\nA constructor has the same name as the class, doesn't begin with\na type annotation and returns nothing.\n\nDefault parameters \n\nIt's a good idea to read on the below constructor initialization lists first\nthen read this before looking at the example code.\nSometimes we may want to have a default value initialised to a data member in\ncase the creator of an object doesn't give it a value.\nIn such situations we have default parameters.\nIn the code below (the one under constructor initialization lists) we see that\nthe constructor assumes that any phone that hasn't had a parameter passed to it\nis a Phablet.\nNote that we have applied overloading to the constructor.\nConstructor initalization lists \n\nThese are also called member initialization lists.\nThey are used to initialize data members and base classes in the cases of\nnon-default constructors.\nWhy do we need constructor initialization lists?\n\nWe save by not having to do an assignment.\nThe compiler knows to construct the object with that value in memory.\n\nIt would otherwise construct the object in memory and then start assigning\nvalues to it's member functions.\nThis would lead be bad for performance.\nExplained further: the difference between using constructor initialization list\nand custom constructors through assignment is run-time speed.\nIf you have a class with a few large data members, assignment construction\n(or constructing by assignment) can create a lot of extra overhead.\nConstructors are used to assign values to data members however the\ninitialization isn't done within the body of constructors; such kind of\ninitialization would actually be assignment and not initialization and would\nhave the drawbacks stated above.\nKeep in mind that data members are initialized in the order they are\ndeclared, not the order they appear in the constructor initialisation list.\nIt is therefore good practice to add the data members to the initializer list\nin the same order they're declared.\nTo quote the wikibook on C++ classes under constructor initialization lists:\nThe C++ standard defines that all initialization of data members are done\nbefore entering the body of constructors.\nThis is the reason why certain types (const types and references) cannot be\nassigned to and must be initialized in the constructor initialization list.\nNote: we didn't assign. The values look like paramters being passed to data\nmembers.\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\nusing namespace std;\n\nclass phones {\n  //Much thanks to crazypyro in ##programming freenode irc\n  string my_name;\npublic:\n  // A default crazypro argument.\n  phones() : my_name( \"Phablet\" ) {\n    cout &lt;&lt; \"Default name is: \" &lt;&lt; this -&gt; get_name () &lt;&lt; endl;\n  }\n  phones(string name) : my_name( name ) {\n    cout &lt;&lt; \"Non default name is: \" &lt;&lt; this -&gt; get_name () &lt;&lt; endl;\n  }\n  string get_name() {return my_name;};\n};\n\nint main() {\n  phones xiamoi;\n  phones samsung (\"Samsung\");\n  return 0;\n}\n\n/*\n  Output:\n\n  Default name is: Phablet\n  Non default name is: Samsung\n*/\n\nWe've overloaded the constructor but used constructor initialization lists\ninstead of assigning values. We also passed a default parameter \"phablet\" to\nthe class phones.\nDestructors \n\nThe Destructor is a special function that is invoked AFTER an object has been\ndestroyed to restore the system to a desired state.\nDestructors, like constructors, are declared like any normal member function but\nwill share the same name as the class and also lack a type annotation and a\nreturn value.\nWhat distinguishes them from constructors is that the destructor's name is\npreceded by a \"~\".\nA destructor also can not have arguments and therefore doesn't require brackets\nafter the destructor name.\nIt also can't be overloaded.\nDestructors are called whenever an object of the class it belongs to is\ndestroyed.\nDestructors are crucial in avoiding resource leaks (by deallocating memory) and\nin implementing the RAII idiom.\nSadly in this section there are some concepts of memory management that you may\nnot be familiar with.\nYou can ignore them and just focus on how to declare a destructor but it might\nbe better if you read this wikibooks page on memory management in C++.\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\nusing namespace std;\n\nclass first {\nint random;\npublic:\n  first() {\n    cout &lt;&lt; \"first created.\" &lt;&lt; endl;\n  }\n  ~first() {\n    cout &lt;&lt; \"first destroyed.\" &lt;&lt; endl;\n  }\n};\n\nclass composition {\nfirst* firstObj;\npublic:\n  composition () {\n    firstObj = new first;\n    if (firstObj != NULL) {\n      cout &lt;&lt; \"firstObj points to an object of first\" &lt;&lt; endl;\n      }\n    cout &lt;&lt; \"An object of composition has been created.\" &lt;&lt; endl;\n  }\n\n  ~composition() {\n    delete firstObj;\n    cout &lt;&lt; \"composition destroyed.\" &lt;&lt; endl;\n  }\n};\n\nint main() {\n  composition com;\n  return 0;\n}\n\n/*\nOutput:\n\nfirst created.\nfirstObj points to an object of first\nAn object of composition has been created.\nfirst destroyed.\ncomposition destroyed.\n\n\nWith delete firsObj ommited:\n\nfirst created.\nfirstObj points to an object of first\nAn object of composition has been created.\ncomposition destroyed.\n\n*/\n\nWe created the object firstObj on the heap and therefore had to destroy it in\nclass composition's destructor (~composition () ).\nIf the line delete firstObj was ommited that would lead to a memory leak\n(memory is held by the program that it shouldn't hold).\nYou can try it out yourself.\nStatic \n\nThe static keyword can be used to:\n\ncreate permanent storage for local variables in a function\nspecify internal linkage\ndeclare member functions that act like non-member functions\ncreate a single copy of a data member\n\nStatic member functions\nMember functions or variables declared static are shared between all instances\nof an object type.\nMeaning that only one copy of the member function or variable exists for any object type\nMember functions callable without an object\nThese member functions are callable even without an object.\nThis means that static member functions can be called without creating instances\nof the class. Normally member functions seem to take an implicit this\nparameter. However, in the case of static member functions this isn't the case,\nsince they behave as some sort of free (not tied to a class) function.\nTo initialize an a static data member you initialize it in the scope right\noutside of the class and refer to it using double semi colons.\nIn the below code we see the static data member, citizens::citizenship, being\ninitialized in line 19.\nWe use the double colon :: to show [scope] that is, the level of abstraction\nthat a part of our program (class, function, variable) belongs to.\nIn this case citizenship and functions inside citizens are declared in a\ndifferent level of abstraction (in class citizens) than where they are being\ncalled in the case of funtions or initialized in the case of data members\n(citizenship).\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\nusing namespace std;\n\nclass citizens {\n  static string citizenship;\n\npublic:\n  citizens () {\n    cout &lt;&lt; \"New citizen created.\";\n  }\n  static void setCitizenship(string ctzn) {\n    citizenship = ctzn;\n  }\n\n  static string getCitizenship() {return citizenship;}\n\n};\n\nstring citizens::citizenship = \"\"; // Initalizing citizenship to an empty string.\n\nint main() {\n  citizens::setCitizenship (\"Kenyan\");\n  cout &lt;&lt; citizens::getCitizenship();\n  return 0;\n}\n\n/*\n  Output:\n\n  Kenyan\n*/\n\nWe are interacting with citizenship without having created a citizen.\nNote that the constructor for citizenship never ran or else we would've seen\nthe output \"New citizen created.\"\nNamed constructors\nNamed constructors are functions used to create an object of a class without\n(directly) using it's constructors.\nGoing by how we said that static member functions can be called without\nbelonging to an object it means we can use static member functions to make a\ncall to a named constructor.\nThis can be translated to manually calling the constructor.\nConsequently, we chose the contructor we want to call.\nOther reasons we may want to use named constructors:\n\nto circumvent the restriction that constructors can be overloaded only if\ntheir signatures differ.\nmaking the class non-inheritable by making the constructors private.\npreventing stack allocation by making constructors private\n\nIn the code below we're taking different doubles but we are passing them\ndifferently to the constructor of the class Temperature.\nIf this was part of an API it would give the programmer more freedom since the\ninternal representation of temparature would be the same but they can think of\ntemperature in the way they are most comfortable.\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\nusing namespace std;\n\nclass Temperature\n{\n    public:\n        //these static functions return a temporary object of type Temperature\n        static Temperature Fahrenheit (double f);\n        static Temperature Celsius (double c);\n        static Temperature Kelvin (double k);\n        //A static member function can't refer to non-static data.\n        double getTemperature() { return _temp; }\n    private:\n        Temperature (double temp); //Constructor is private.\n        double _temp;\n};\n\n//_temp instantiated outside of Temparature class.\nTemperature::Temperature (double temp):_temp (temp) {}\n\nTemperature Temperature::Fahrenheit (double f)\n{ return Temperature ((f + 459.67) / 1.8); }\n\nTemperature Temperature::Celsius (double c)\n{ return Temperature (c + 273.15); }\n\nTemperature Temperature::Kelvin (double k)\n{ return Temperature (k); }\n\nint main() {\n  // We are initializing the objects created here via kelvin(), celsius() and fahrenheit()\n  // to objects\n  // kelvin, celsius and fahrenheit.\n  Temperature kelvin = Temperature::Kelvin (300.0);\n  Temperature celsius = Temperature::Celsius (26.85);\n  Temperature fahrenheit = Temperature::Fahrenheit(80.33);\n\n  cout &lt;&lt; \"Entered kelvin \" &lt;&lt; kelvin.getTemperature () &lt;&lt; endl;\n  cout &lt;&lt; \"Entered celsius \" &lt;&lt; celsius.getTemperature () &lt;&lt; endl;\n  cout &lt;&lt; \"Entered fahrenheit \" &lt;&lt; fahrenheit.getTemperature () &lt;&lt; endl;\n\n  return 0;\n}\n\n/*\nOutput:\n\nEntered kelvin 300\nEntered celsius 300\nEntered fahrenheit 300\n*/\n\nOne cannot define a static function ( or a member function) that refers to\nnon-static data.\nWe are initializing the objects created here via functions Kelvin(), Celsius()\nand Fahrenheit() to objects kelvin, celsius and fahrenheit so these objects will\nbe created holding these objects.\nThe static functions in this code example return a temporary object of type\nTemperature each.\nComposition \n\nA composition is a class which has at least one of it's data members being an\nobject of another class.\nFor example below the class composition is a composition.\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\nusing namespace std;\n\nclass bird {\n  string species;\n\npublic:\n  bird () {\n    cout &lt;&lt; \"New bird created.\" &lt;&lt; endl;\n  }\n  void setSpecies (string sp) {\n    species = sp;\n  }\n  string getSpecies () {\n    return species;\n  }\n};\n\nclass composition {\n  bird chicken;\n};\n\nint main() {\n  composition newComposition;\n  return 0;\n}\n\n/*\n  Output:\n\n  New bird created.\n*/\nInheritance \n\nSo inheritance is a rather huge topic for me to explain here.\nIt's best you read it elsewhere.\nI shall just explain how to do inheritance in C++.\nMultiple inheritance to be specific.\nIn the below case we shall have 3 classes\n\ntwo base classes\n\nbaseClassA\nbaseClassB;\n\n\none child class that will inherit from both classes\n\nchildClass.\n\n\n\nWe shall see the use of constructor initialization lists with multiple\ninheritance and regarding constructors of parent classes.\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\nusing namespace std;\n\nclass baseClassA {\n  string aString;\npublic:\n  baseClassA (string aStr): aString(aStr) {\n    cout &lt;&lt; \"Base class A object created.\" &lt;&lt; endl;\n  }\n};\n\nclass baseClassB {\n  int bInt;\npublic:\n  baseClassB (int bin): bInt(bin) {\n    cout &lt;&lt; \"Base class B object created\" &lt;&lt; endl;\n  }\n};\n\nclass childClass: public baseClassA, public baseClassB {\n  bool cBool;\npublic:\n  childClass(bool bul, string aStr, int bIn): cBool(bul), baseClassA(aStr), baseClassB (bIn) {\n    cout &lt;&lt; \"Child class of multiple inheritance object created.\" &lt;&lt; endl;\n  }\n};\n\nint main() {\n  childClass kid (true, \"cats\", 3);\n  return 0;\n}\n\n/*\n  Output:\n\n  Base class A object created.\n  Base class B object created\n  Child class of multiple inheritance object created.\n*/\nDynamic Polymorphism \n\nIt would do you better to read this Dynamic polymorphism but since I already\nread it I'll just give you the part that I feel is most relevant.\nSuppose that we have two classes, A and B. B derives from A and redefines the\nimplementation of a method c() that resides in class A.\nNow suppose that we have an object b of class B. How should the instruction\nb.c() be interpreted?\nIf b is declared in the stack (not declared as a pointer or a reference) the\ncompiler applies static binding, this means it interprets (at compile time)\nthat we refer to the implementation of c() that resides in B.\nHowever, if we declare b as a pointer or a reference of class A, the compiler\ncould not know which method to call at compile time, because b can be of type\nA or B.\nIf this is resolved at run time, the method that resides in B will be called.\nThis is called dynamic binding. If this is resolved at compile time, the\nmethod that resides in A will be called. This is again, static binding.\nVirtual Member Funtions \n\nVirtual member functions are member functions, that can be overridden in any\nclass derived from the one where they were declared.\nSort of like you can \"overwrite\" the funtion in the derived class.\nThis is done by placing the keyword virtual before the method declaration.\nFor example\nvirtual memberFunc() {\n    /*Member function code*/\n}\n\nThe point is that when the compiler has to decide between applying static\nbinding or dynamic binding it will apply dynamic binding. Otherwise, static\nbinding will be applied.\nIf the base class function is virtual all subclass overrides of it will also be\nvirtual.\nHowever it is still good practice to add the virtual keyword before function\ndefinitions in subclasses, clarity and all.\nIn this case assume we were simulating marketing companies in the world so.\nThe new one will redefine marketing.

This leads to a world of hurt because the test/ directory also has a Main.main function.\nPlease report an issue if you would like any file ignored during builds.\nMoved to stack \n\nSince the Haskell community has moved in this direction, so has wai-devel.\nwai-devel only depends on cabal in that stack and ide-backend depend on Cabal the library.\nOtherwise, the cabal binary is not used and hasn't been tested to work with wai-devel.\nCompatible versions of GHC \n\nCurrently wai-devel is built and tested against:\n\nGHC-7.8\nGHC-7.10\n\nRegarding file watching \n\nwai-devel watches for file changes on files with the following extensions:\n\nhamlet\nshamlet\njulius\nlucius\nhs\nyaml\n\nWhen a change takes place wai-devel will recompile and re-run your application\non localhost:3001 or display an error if any on the browser at localhost:3000\nIf you would want another extension added to the list of file extensions to watch for please report it as an issue.\nCommand line arguments \n\nCurrently wai-devel takes only these two arguments and the two are optional.\nIf you feel the need for more arguments please report it as an issue on github.\n\n\n-r to turn off reverse proxying\nIf this is turned on you will access your application at an address that is specific to\nyour web application or web framework.\n\n\n--show-iface [hi file] passes this command to ghc\nSame as ghc --show-iface\n\n\n","id":"https://njagi.me/progress-with-wai-devel/","title":"Progress with wai-devel"},"https://njagi.me/pulseaudio-mute-on-boot/":{"body":"This might work for you or fail to.

Instead, just provide a listener\nwhen the element is initially rendered.\nYou have to be careful about the meaning of this in JSX callbacks. In JavaScript,\nclass methods are not bound by default. If you forget to bind this.handleClick \nand pass it to onClick, this will be undefined when the function is actually \ncalled.\nUnderstanding JavaScript Bind ()\nYou can use an arrow fn in the callback e.g onClick={(e) =&gt; this.handleClick(e)}\nThe problem with this syntax is that a different callback is created each time \nthe LoggingButton renders.\nIn most cases, this is fine. However, if this callback is passed as a prop to \nlower components, those components might do an extra re-rendering.\nWe generally recommend binding in the constructor or using the class fields \nsyntax, to avoid this sort of performance problem.\nLifecycle hooks \n\nMethods run during the life cycle events\nsuch as mounting and umounting\n\ncomponentDidMount: runs after the component output has been \nrendered to the DOM.\ncomponentWillUnmount: \n\nthis.setState({}) takes an object of new state\nconstructor runs before the object is created\nmodifying state directly e.g this.state.comment = \"I'm new...\" \ndoesn't lead to a rerender. use set state\nThe only place where you can assign this.state is the \nconstructor.\nRead more under:\n\nReact.Component https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html\n\nkaznet \n\nApp.js has all the paths\ntriggers container for that component\nHooks \n\nFrom Kent C.

The previous post explains various things like naming of stuff in C++ which is different from naming conventions in other languages.\n\nThis one is about explaining scope in C++ when we have inheritance and non-default constructors as well as compositions.\nThe piont of this post is to establish:\n\nWhat order are constructors called in case we create an object of a derived class.\nWhat order are destructors called in case we destroy an object of a derived class.\nIn the case of compositions (objects as data members) which constructors are called first.

I wish African leaders would debate along these lines and actually do something about it.\nThis post is about getting people to learn about Solar Power in Africa and talk about it.\nOil industry is big because it is an energy source, right? Compare this to knowing that we have a better renewable type of oil in our land but doing nothing about it. I do admit that the cost of the undertaking would be huge but that shouldn't stop us. In fact I there is this line I read in the article:\nMany African countries receive on average 325 days per year of bright sunlight. This gives solar power the potential to bring energy to virtually any location in Africa without the need for expensive large scale grid level infrastructural developments.\nSo we have even hours of daylight and darkness already working in our favour, right?\nIf Africa were able to control just it's energy sources let alone the worlds it would have a ripple effect on the cost of products made in Africa not to mention the quality of life et al. Obviously energy is an untapped sector that could do Africa a lot of good the saddest part is knowing that I will probably die before it is exploited. I don't know about you but to me clean energy is something humanity should aim at achieving.\nThe rest of the paragraph goes on to read: The Desertec project is a proposal to provide 15% of Europe's energy from the desert.\nMoreover, a recent study indicates that a solar generating facility covering just 0.3% of the area comprising North Africa could supply all of the energy required by the European Union.\nSo Europe saw this and decided to act upon it. I sought figures on Europe's power consumption to compare with Africa's from wolfram alpha.\n    _Format_ Query: Result\n    2010 estimates.\n    kW h/yr means (kilowatt hours per year)\n\n    Europe power consumption: `total | 3.409 trillion kW h/yr`\n    15% of Europe Power Consumption: `511.3 billion kW h/yr`\n    Africa power consumption: `total | 559.6 billion kW h/yr`\n    africa power consumption+(15% of europe power consumption): `1.071 trillion kW h/yr`\n\nOk so let me get this right. We could've almost matched Africa's power consumption by just doing what Europe did? This is obviously HUGE! albeit from a renewable and clean source. \nSo I have a line graph for this comparing:\n    - africa power consumption\n    - europe power consumption\n    - 15% of europe power consumption\n    - africa power consumption+(15% of europe power consumption)\n\nSee it as a graph of where we are, where Europe is and where we would be if we gave minimal shit!\nFor a line graph see: line graph\n\nNote that 15% of Europes power consumption is just about on the same line as Africa's power consumption so it's hard to tell apart.\nI couldn't get an image of the graph because I haven't written code to do so and also because I don't have a wolfram alpha pro account. However if you're reading this clicking on a link won't hurt.\nI know General Electric too has seen potential and invested in this but what have Africans done in this sector?\nA few other interesting parts:\n    A 50 MW photovoltaic power plant is planned for Garissa, in Kenya, \n    which is expected to produce approximately 76,473 MWh/year.\n\n    A 155 MW photovoltaic power plant is planned for Ghana, \n    and is expected to be completed in 2015.\n\n    A 75 MW solar power plant started production on September 13th, 2013 in Kalkbult,\n    in South Africa's Northern Cape (implemented by Scatec). \n\nIt is obvious that something is being done along these lines and I am happy Kenya is involved but it is obviously not enough. I really feel that Kenya would've done better if it didn't have it's priorities in it's anus and embraced a form of socialism.\nWe should not downplay the role solar power can play in energy as most would China and Germany which are the top two exporters in the world are doing a lot on solar power as well as other forms of renewable energy.\nAnother wikipedia article shows the continent's potential with solar power Solar power by country\nIt's a shame that Africa's subsection is only one paragraph instead of being broken down to info on solar power in individual african nations. To demonstrate just how short that paragraph is I shall paste it here.\n    On average, many African countries receive up to 325 days of sunlight per year.\n    This gives solar power the potential to bring energy to virtually any location \n    in Africa  without the need for expensive large scale grid level\n    infrastructural developments.\n\n    The distribution of solar resources across Africa is fairly uniform, with more than\n    80 percent of the African landscape receiving almost 2000 kW·h per square meter \n    per year.\n    A recent study indicates that a solar generating facility covering just 0.3% of\n    the area comprising North Africa could supply all of the energy required by \n    the European Union\n\nI know this might be an issue of solar power developments not having been documented, but why? It is obviously just not a priority. We are good at documenting politics so we have the ability. \nAnother interesting article one should read on the same is Renewable energy in Africa\nI hope this convinces someone that Africa has the potential of being a leader in energy generation not just renewable energy and someone with the ability to do something about it will see it, actually give a fuck and do something about it.\n","id":"https://njagi.me/solar-power-in-africa/","title":"Solar Power in Africa"},"https://njagi.me/statistics/":{"body":"A link to notes (PDF) I had when I took a statistics unit a while ago.

Especially those who have no idea what a runtime system is and is a gross oversimplification. :) Let's go. Later I will write something about the haskell runtime system.\n\nThis post was inspired by The GHC Runtime System by Edward Z. Yang (2013) and A Runtime System by Andrew W. Appel (1989).\nI also tried reading: The Implementation of Functional Programming Languages by Simon Peyton Jones, published by Prentice Hall, 1987. and Implementing functional languages: a tutorial by Simon Peyton Jones and David Lester. Published by Prentice Hall, 1992. but they're really big and quite dated. You may also read wikipedia on runtime systems.\nSo what is a runtime system? It is a program that is invoked by the compiler to wrap your compiled program/code and gives it bindings to the \"API\" provided by the environment(operating system) that the program is running in.\nSo the runtime system can't run on it's own. It only runs when the program, for example a haskell program, is running and as you would expect the runtime system would vary between operating systems because the environments are different.\nIt provides primitive langauge features unlike a standard library which is typically implemented in the language itself.\nWe count on the runtime system to provide the following services among others:\n\nGarbage collection.\nStreaming input and output.\nStructured input and output.\nProcess suspension\nHandling interrupts and asynchronous events.\nOperating system calls.\nArithmetic interrupts.\nExecution profiling.\nAssembly language implementation of language primitives.\nDebugging.\nFun with continuation.\nForeign language procedure calls.\n\nHaskell runtime system. \n\nHaskell features that complicate the design of the runtime system:\n\nLazy evaluation. No clear order of execution\nUbiquitous concurrency.\n\nHowever, emphasis on pure computation simplifies the design of the garbage collector and Software Transactional Memory.\nGHC and the haskell runtime system. \n\nGHC is broken down into three parts.\n\nThe compiler\nThe runtime system\nThe boot/base libraries.\n\nAs you can see the runtime system is developed as part of GHC but not part of the compiler itself.\nConclusion \n\nI can't keep this on without turning these into notes I wrote down when reading a paper.

It's name is yesod-devel.\nThis post is about yesod-devel which is my Google Summer of Code project and not the current yesod-devel that is part of the yesod framework. It's not yet available and is still under development, meaning a lot of things in this post may change.\n\nyesod-devel is a development server for haskell web applications that are WAI compliant.\nWhat we expect from the application. \n\nThis is my opinion of what I expect from the web application and this may therefore change depending on what the community thinks. I think this design is good and losely coupled and leaves a lot of freedom to the web application.\nAt the heart of your application (the root of your web application) we expect you to have an Application.hs file which holds the Appliaction module. This is the file pointed to by your main-is section of the .cabal file.:\nThis Application.hs file holds the main function which fires up a warp server at a an address and port specified in an environment variable.\nYesod devel will read everything it needs from the web application from environment variables and not from a config file.\nIt is the responsibility of the web application to set environment variables(setEnv). This way yesod-devel is very losely coupled to the web application. That is, we(yesod-devel) will not have to specify the names, paths of your config files or which serialization format it will use.\nThe environment variables we currently need are:\nhaskellWebAddress=\"&lt;ip_address&gt;/localhost\"\nhaskellWebPort=\"&lt;port_number&gt;\"\nWhat you should expect from yesod-devel. \n\nAutomatic source and data file discovery. \n\nYou shouldn't expect to tell yesod-devel where your source files or data files (hamelet files and so forth) are as long as your web application knows where everything is. All you need to do is call the yesod-devel binary inside your app's root.\nBuilding and running your code. \n\nyesod-devel when run in your web application's working directory will run build and run your application on localhost:3000.\nAutomatic code reloading. \n\nYesod-devel supports automatic code reloading for any file modified in the current working directory. This is more proof of just how losely coupled yesod-devel will be from your application.\nNewly added files don't trigger a recompile and neither do deleted files. However, file modifications do trigger a recompile.\nThis is a deliberate design choice. Text editors as well as other programs keep adding and removing files from the file system and if we listened for any randomly created file or deleted file to trigger a recompile we would end up triggering useless recompiles.\nThis however means there's a trade-off. For being so losely coupled we have to manually restart yesod-devel everytime we add or delete files.\nReverse proxying. \n\nYesod-devel will start listening on the address and port specified in your environment variables haskellWebAddress and haskellWebPort respectively and reverse proxy it to your localhost:3000.\nReport error messages to the browser. \n\nYesod-devel will report error messages from ghc to the web browser on localhost:3000.\nCommand line arguments. \n\nCurrently yesod-devel takes no command line arguments.\nHowever, in the plans are the following.\n\n--configure-with \n--no-reverse-proxying\n--show-iface fileName.hs\n\nYou should be fine without passing any of these arguments unless you have a special reason to.\nCurrently yesod-devel will configure your web application with the following flags to cabal.\n\n-flibrary-only\n--disable-tests\"\n--disable-benchmarks\"\n-fdevel\n--disable-library-profiling\n--with-ld=yesod-ld-wrapper\n--with-ghc=yesod-ghc-wrapper\n--with-ar=yesod-ar-wrapper\n--with-hc-pkg=ghc-pkg\n\nI assume that these arguments are self explanatory.\n","id":"https://njagi.me/yesod-devel/","title":"yesod-devel"}},"docInfo":{"https://njagi.me/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://njagi.me/apple-deprecates-the-use-of-openssl/":{"body":126,"title":4},"https://njagi.me/back-to-chess/":{"body":138,"title":2},"https://njagi.me/code-pipeline-overview/":{"body":484,"title":2},"https://njagi.me/code-pipeline-putting-everything-together/":{"body":893,"title":4},"https://njagi.me/creating-the-initial-variation-graph/":{"body":825,"title":4},"https://njagi.me/deep-work/":{"body":3573,"title":2},"https://njagi.me/dm-crypt-systemd-boot-and-efi-on-archlinux/":{"body":648,"title":7},"https://njagi.me/emacs-cheatsheet/":{"body":245,"title":2},"https://njagi.me/emacs-setup-for-haskell/":{"body":1725,"title":3},"https://njagi.me/encrypted-flash-drive/":{"body":142,"title":4},"https://njagi.me/google-summer-of-code-2015/":{"body":284,"title":4},"https://njagi.me/google-summer-of-code-2019-final-submission/":{"body":777,"title":5},"https://njagi.me/how-to-apply-a-patch-quickly/":{"body":43,"title":2},"https://njagi.me/imports-and-exports-as-documentation/":{"body":362,"title":3},"https://njagi.me/introduction-to-variation-graphs/":{"body":972,"title":3},"https://njagi.me/justifying-sha256-in-graphite/":{"body":659,"title":3},"https://njagi.me/logicomix/":{"body":974,"title":1},"https://njagi.me/mail-at-urbanslug/":{"body":331,"title":2},"https://njagi.me/man-in-the-arena/":{"body":115,"title":2},"https://njagi.me/my-gnome-3-experience/":{"body":176,"title":3},"https://njagi.me/notes-on-idesession/":{"body":534,"title":2},"https://njagi.me/object-oriented-programming-in-c/":{"body":2216,"title":4},"https://njagi.me/packaging-python-projects/":{"body":143,"title":3},"https://njagi.me/pass-for-ios/":{"body":381,"title":2},"https://njagi.me/progress-with-wai-devel/":{"body":439,"title":3},"https://njagi.me/pulseaudio-mute-on-boot/":{"body":67,"title":3},"https://njagi.me/react/":{"body":1523,"title":3},"https://njagi.me/scope-in-inheritance-and-composition-in-c/":{"body":189,"title":4},"https://njagi.me/solar-power-in-africa/":{"body":573,"title":3},"https://njagi.me/statistics/":{"body":2385,"title":1},"https://njagi.me/threadscope-patch/":{"body":94,"title":2},"https://njagi.me/universal-environment-variables/":{"body":139,"title":5},"https://njagi.me/viruses/":{"body":131,"title":1},"https://njagi.me/wai-devel-final-submission/":{"body":232,"title":4},"https://njagi.me/what-is-a-runtime-system-haskell/":{"body":239,"title":2},"https://njagi.me/yesod-devel/":{"body":343,"title":2}},"length":37},"lang":"English"};
